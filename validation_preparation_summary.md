### 3. Batch Execution Planning ✅ COMPLETED
- Structured validation into 5 sequential batches:
  - Batch 1: Sections A & B (Project setup + BGG metadata)
  - Batch 2: Sections C & D (Rulebook ingestion + Visual assets)
  - Batch 3: Sections E & F (Narration/audio + Subtitles)
  - Batch 4: Sections G & H (Rendering + Quality checks)
  - Batch 5: Sections I-K (Packaging, CI hooks, delivery)

### 4. Validation Protocol Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- Evidence capture mechanisms with standardized naming
- Issue logging process with root-cause analysis
- Regression testing requirements
- Cross-platform validation procedures
- Completion gate criteria

### 5. Risk Mitigation ✅ COMPLETED
