# Mobius Games Tutorial Generator - TutorialOrchestrator Fixes

This patch includes all the fixes and improvements made to the TutorialOrchestrator component:

## 1. Fixed React Hooks ESLint Error

The main issue was that hooks were being called conditionally, which violates React's Rules of Hooks.
The solution was to restructure the component to separate the environment variable check from the hook calls.

## 2. Fixed Duplicate Export Issue

Removed duplicate `export default TutorialOrchestrator;` statement that was causing build errors.

## 3. Enhanced Environment Variable Helper

Improved the getEnv function in utils/env.js to provide better type conversion.

## 4. Added Environment Variable Documentation

Added REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL to .env.example and README.md

## 5. Added Diagnostic Logging

Added temporary diagnostic console logs to verify environment variable values at runtime.

## 6. Added Unit Test

Created a basic unit test to verify the component's visibility behavior.

## 7. Added Service Worker Unregistration Utility

Created a utility to help with clearing cached assets during development.

## Files Modified:

1. client/src/components/TutorialOrchestrator.jsx
2. client/src/utils/env.js
3. client/.env.example
4. README.md
5. client/src/components/TutorialOrchestrator.test.jsx
