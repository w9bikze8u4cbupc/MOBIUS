# Frontend Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Corrupted App.jsx file**: The client/src/App.jsx file was severely corrupted with repeated content and invalid syntax, causing the frontend to fail to compile.

2. **HMR/hot-update 500 errors**: The corrupted file was causing hot-update.json requests to return 500 errors.

3. **WebSocket retry spam**: Repeated WebSocket connection failures were occurring due to the HMR issues.

4. **Backup file corruption**: Leftover backup files were causing repeated corruption of the App.jsx file.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Replaced corrupted App.jsx**:
   - Deleted the corrupted client/src/App.jsx file
   - Created a clean client/src/App.js file with proper React component structure
   - Used React.createElement syntax to avoid potential JSX transform issues

2. **Updated index.js**:
   - Confirmed that conditional rendering logic is properly handled in client/src/index.js
   - The index.js file already correctly switches between DevTestPage and App based on REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST environment variable

3. **Enhanced .gitignore**:
   - Added entries to prevent backup files from being committed:
     ```
     # editor/backup files
     *.backup
     *.bak
     *~
     # temporary App backup
     client/src/App.js
     client/src/App.jsx.backup
     ```

4. **Cleaned up backup files**:
   - Removed corrupted backup files that were causing repeated corruption

5. **Added pre-commit hook**:
   - Created a pre-commit hook to check for BOM (Byte Order Mark) and binary bytes in JavaScript/JSX files
   - This will help prevent future corruption issues

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Verified frontend serves HTML correctly at http://localhost:3001/
2. ✅ Verified backend health endpoint at http://localhost:5001/healthz
3. ✅ Tested extract endpoint with properly formatted JSON
4. ✅ Confirmed no repeated WebSocket errors or HMR 500 errors

## Current State

- Frontend (http://localhost:3001/) and backend (http://localhost:5001/) are running correctly
- HMR / hot-update 500 and repeated WebSocket retries are resolved
- File corruption issues are prevented through .gitignore updates and pre-commit hook
- The application correctly displays the TutorialOrchestrator component

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor for regressions**: Keep an eye on the console for any WebSocket errors or HMR issues
2. **Maintain .gitignore**: Ensure backup file patterns are kept up to date
3. **Use the pre-commit hook**: The hook will automatically check for file corruption issues before commits
