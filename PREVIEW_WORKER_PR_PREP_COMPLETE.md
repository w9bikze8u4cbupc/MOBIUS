### 6. CI/CD
- CI workflow for testing (`/.github/workflows/ci-preview-worker.yml`)

## Next Steps for Finalizing the PR

### Option 1: Use the Complete PR Body (Recommended)
```bash
# Create feature branch and replace image tag in manifests
git checkout -b feat/preview-worker-k8s-final
./scripts/update-preview-worker-image.sh YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0

# Commit manifests & docs
git add k8s/preview-worker scripts systemd PREVIEW_WORKER_*.md PR_BODY_PREVIEW_WORKER_COMPLETE.md
git commit -m "chore(k8s): finalize preview-worker manifests and cross-platform ops"

# Push branch and open PR (example using GitHub CLI)
git push -u origin feat/preview-worker-k8s-final
gh pr create --title "k8s: add preview-worker manifests + cross-platform deployment tooling (BullMQ preview worker)" \
  --body-file PR_BODY_PREVIEW_WORKER_COMPLETE.md --base main --head feat/preview-worker-k8s-final
```

### Option 2: Manual PR Creation
1. Create a new branch from `feat/preview-worker-ci`
2. Update the image tag in `k8s/preview-worker/deployment.yaml` with your actual image
3. Commit all changes
4. Push the branch
5. Create a PR using the content from `PR_BODY_PREVIEW_WORKER_COMPLETE.md`

## Cross-Platform Image Update Instructions

```

## One-line Commands / Quick Reference

### Run payload tests:
```bash
npm run test:preview-payloads
```

### Update manifests image (POSIX):
```bash
./scripts/update-preview-worker-image.sh YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0
```

### Update manifests image (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\scripts\update-preview-worker-image.ps1 -ImageTag "YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0"
```

### Deploy to staging:
```bash
kubectl -n preview-worker apply -f k8s/preview-worker/
```

### Health check (port-forward):
```bash
kubectl -n preview-worker port-forward deployment/preview-worker 3000:3000 &
curl localhost:3000/api/preview/worker/health
```

## Acceptance Criteria (Must be Met Before Merging)

- [ ] All CI checks pass (payload validation + unit tests)
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 and Redis connectivity is OK in staging
- [ ] Dry-run jobs recorded and do not call renderPreview
- [ ] A real job completes end-to-end in staging (or reaches expected artifact generation step)
- [ ] Prometheus scrapes metrics and alert rules configured (tested in staging)
- [ ] Secrets are externalized; no sensitive data committed

## Production Blockers (Must be Resolved Before Production)

- [ ] Replace image placeholder in k8s manifests with the pushed image: `YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:TAG`
- [ ] Provision and wire secrets (Redis password, registry creds, external service keys) into Kubernetes Secrets or a vault
- [ ] Confirm Redis production connectivity and HA/credentials
- [ ] Tune HPA thresholds and alert thresholds to real traffic volumes

The Preview Worker implementation is now complete and ready for final review and deployment. All necessary components, documentation, and tooling have been prepared.
