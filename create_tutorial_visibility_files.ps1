feat(tutorial): add env helper, debug flag, .env.example, docs, tests, and CI workflow

- Adds a centralized env helper (client/src/utils/env.js) to parse:
  - REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL (boolean)
  - REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL (boolean)
- Integrates helper into TutorialOrchestrator.jsx and gates diagnostic logging to development when REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL=true
- Adds client/.env.example and README updates documenting usage
- Adds unit tests for helper and component visibility
- Adds validation scripts and cross-platform automation scripts
- Adds GitHub Actions CI (/.github/workflows/tutorial-visibility-ci.yml) that runs lint, tests, and build on PRs (strict linting; warnings fail CI)

Title: Make tutorial generator visibility configurable via environment variables

Summary:
- Introduces REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL to toggle the "A→Z Tutorial Generator" UI without code changes.
- Introduces REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL to enable development-only diagnostic logging (gated to NODE_ENV=development).
- Adds a centralized env helper, unit tests, validation scripts, documentation, and CI to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

Post-merge cleanup & tagging (run locally after merging)

1) Update local main and delete local feature branch:
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feat/tutorial-visibility-ci

2) Delete remote branch:
   git push origin --delete feat/tutorial-visibility-ci

3) Create & push a release tag (replace vX.Y.Z):
   NEW_TAG=vX.Y.Z
   git tag -a $NEW_TAG -m "Release $NEW_TAG — tutorial visibility feature"
   git push origin $NEW_TAG

Notes:
- Use semantic versioning consistent with your release cadence.
- Optionally create a GitHub release using the released tag and the release-note snippet.

Quick smoke test (after deploying to staging or serving production build locally)

1) Build & serve:
   cd client
   npm run build
   npx serve -s build

2) Verify toggles:
   - REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL=false  -> A→Z UI is hidden
   - REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL=true   -> A→Z UI is present

3) Confirm debug flag:
   - REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL has NO effect in production (NODE_ENV=production)
   - Diagnostic logs only appear in development when NODE_ENV=development && REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL=true

4) Manual UX sanity:
   - Navigate pages that used TutorialOrchestrator previously
   - Execute primary flows that may have interacted with tutorial UI
   - Confirm no runtime console errors and page load is normal

# Create TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_MONITORING.md

Monitoring checklist (first 24–72 hours post-merge)

1) CI & Build
   - Monitor CI for unexpected failures on subsequent PRs

2) Error & Performance Monitoring
   - Watch Sentry / Datadog / NewRelic for new exceptions originating around TutorialOrchestrator
   - Ensure no spike of client-side errors tied to the change

3) Client logs / Console
   - Verify no debug logs leak into production
   - Check for repeated warnings or deprecation messages

4) UX Regression
   - Verify primary user journeys are intact (login, dashboard, tutorial flows)
   - Confirm lazy-loaded chunks still load normally

5) Rollback readiness
   - Ensure rollback PR procedure is documented and team knows how to trigger it quickly
'@ > TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_MONITORING.md

# Create TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_ROLLBACK.md
@'
Quick rollback (if the merged change needs to be undone)

1) Identify the problematic merge commit hash on main (MERGE_HASH)

2) Revert the merge commit on main (create a new revert commit):
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git revert -m 1 MERGE_HASH
   git push origin main

3) Optionally open a new PR from the revert branch to allow review

4) If immediate restore is required on deployed environment:
   - Deploy previous release (tag) to staging/production as per your deployment flow

Notes:
- Reverting creates a commit that undoes the merge; this is safer than force-pushing main.
- If the issue is small, prefer a follow-up PR with a targeted fix instead of full revert.

Reviewer Guidance (paste as PR comment)

Thanks for reviewing — this PR centralizes environment parsing for tutorial visibility and makes the A→Z UI toggleable via REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL. CI is strict: lint, tests, and build must pass.

Please verify:
- CI green and no lint warnings (CI fails on warnings)
- Unit tests for env helper and TutorialOrchestrator pass
- Local manual checks:
  - Toggle REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL in client/.env, restart dev server, confirm UI appears/disappears
  - Toggle REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL only in development and verify diagnostic log appears
- Confirm .env.example and README updates are accurate
- Confirm there are no stray console.debug statements outside the gated debug branch

If CI is green and checks are OK, approve and squash-merge using the provided commit message.
