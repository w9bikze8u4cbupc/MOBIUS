# Diagnostic Report: Aâ†’Z Tutorial Generator vs DevTestPage Confusion

## Issue Clarification

After thorough investigation, I've discovered that there's a misunderstanding about what UI is actually being displayed:

1. **DevTestPage** - This is a developer/test page with buttons for "Run Extract Metadata" and "Run Web Search"
2. **TutorialOrchestrator** - This is the main user interface with the "ðŸŽ¬ Aâ†’Z Tutorial Generator" title

## Current State Analysis

1. The environment variable `REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST=false` is correctly set in `client/.env`
2. The `getShowDevTest()` helper function in `client/src/utils/env.js` is correctly implemented
3. The App.jsx file is correctly using the environment variable to decide which component to render
4. **The temporary fix I implemented is working correctly** - the application is showing TutorialOrchestrator, not DevTestPage

## What You're Actually Seeing

When you see the "ðŸŽ¬ Aâ†’Z Tutorial Generator" title, you are looking at the **TutorialOrchestrator** component, which is the correct main UI for the application. This is NOT the DevTestPage.

The DevTestPage has a completely different UI with:
- "Dev / Test Page" heading
- "Use this page for targeted validation of API helpers, toasts, and QA gates." text
- "Run Extract Metadata" and "Run Web Search" buttons

## Verification

To confirm this is working correctly:

1. Check that you see the TutorialOrchestrator UI with:
   - "ðŸŽ¬ Aâ†’Z Tutorial Generator" heading
   - PDF URL input field
   - Website URL input field
   - Language selector
   - "ðŸš€ Generate Tutorial" button

2. If you see the DevTestPage instead, then there would be an issue with the environment variable handling.

## Next Steps

1. **Remove the temporary fix**: Since the environment variable approach should work, we can revert to using the [getShowDevTest()](file://c:\Users\danie\Documents\mobius-games-tutorial-generator\client\src\utils\env.js#L0-L4) function
2. **Test with the proper implementation**: Change the line in App.jsx back to:
   ```javascript
   const SHOW_DEV_TEST = getShowDevTest();
   ```
3. **Restart the development server** to ensure the environment variables are loaded correctly

The application is currently working as expected - it's showing the main Tutorial Generator UI, not the developer test page.
