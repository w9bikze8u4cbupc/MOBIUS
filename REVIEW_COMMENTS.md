# Sample Review Comments for MOBIUS Verification PR

## Positive Feedback Comments

### For Code Quality
```
‚úÖ Great work on the cross-platform compatibility! The paired .sh and .ps1 scripts are well-implemented and follow the project's standards.
```

### For Documentation
```
üìö Excellent documentation! The MOBIUS_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md file provides clear guidance on all the new scripts and their usage.
```

### For CI/CD Integration
```
üöÄ The GitHub Actions workflow looks solid. Good job integrating the verification into CI for automated testing.
```

### For Completeness
```
üéØ This is a comprehensive solution that covers all the requirements. The addition of utility scripts for port management and folder consolidation is a nice touch.
```

## Questions/Clarifications

### About Script Behavior
```
‚ùì Can you clarify the expected behavior when the backend or frontend fails to start within the timeout period? I see there's error handling, but it might be helpful to document this in the README.
```

### About Configuration
```
‚ùì Should we make the SMOKE_CMD configurable via environment variables for easier customization in different environments?
```

### About Port Configuration
```
‚ùì The scripts currently hardcode ports 5001 and 3000. Should these be configurable to support different deployment scenarios?
```

## Suggestions for Improvement

### For Error Handling
```
üí° Consider adding more detailed logging for different failure scenarios. This would help with debugging when verification fails in CI.
```

### For Cross-Platform Consistency
```
üí° It might be helpful to add a small wrapper function for common operations (like file operations) to ensure consistency between the bash and PowerShell scripts.
```

### For Documentation
```
üí° Consider adding a quick start section to the main README that highlights the new verification commands for easy discovery.
```
