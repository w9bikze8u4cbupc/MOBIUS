[Show different components one-by-one]
"In your Hanamikoji box, you'll find 7 Geisha Cards, 8 Action Markers, 21 Item Cards, 7 Victory Markers, 1 Secret marker, and 1 Trade-off marker. Each card and marker plays an essential role in your journey to win the favors of the Geishas."

[Setup]
[Show the game setup]
"To set up the game, place the 7 Geisha cards in a row between the players. Then, place one Victory Marker in the center of each Geisha Card. Stack the Item Cards face-down into a pile and place them aside. Each player takes 4 Action Markers of the same color with the colored side up. The younger player starts the game."

[Objective]
[Show Geisha cards up close]
"The aim of Hanamikoji is to win 4 Geishas or accumulate 11 or more Charm Points. You do this by collecting and strategically playing Item Cards that match the Geishas' preferences. The game continues until either player reaches the winning goal."

[Gameplay Flow]
[Show Action Markers]
"Starting with the first player, each turn consists of drawing an Item Card and performing an action. There are 4 actions you can perform, and each one has its own unique marker. Once you perform an action, flip the marker face-down. This continues until all actions have been performed."

[Key Rules & Special Cases]
[Show Action Markers and Item Cards]
"Each of the 4 actions has specific rules. For instance, the 'Secret' action allows you to place a face-down card from your hand under the Secret marker, to be revealed and scored later. The 'Trade-off' action lets you place two face-down cards under the Trade-off marker that won't be scored in this round. The 'Gift' action requires you to reveal three cards, where your opponent chooses one, and you keep the rest. The 'Competition' action is where you reveal four cards, divide them into two sets, and your opponent chooses one set."

[Example Turn]
[Show an example turn]
"Let's say you have a turn. First, you draw an Item Card. Then, you choose to perform the 'Gift' action. You reveal three cards from your hand and your opponent chooses one to place on their side. The remaining two cards go on your side."

[End Game & Scoring]
[Show scoring process]
"Once both players have performed all 4 actions, the scoring phase begins. Players reveal the card under their Secret marker and compare the number of Item Cards on both sides of each Geisha. The side with more Item Cards wins the Geisha, moving the Victory Marker to their side. If it's a draw or there are no cards, the Victory Marker stays in place. The game ends if any player wins 4 Geishas or accumulates 11 or more Charm Points."

[Tips/Strategy/Common Mistakes]
[Show thoughtful expression]
"Strategically choosing which action to perform and when is crucial in Hanamikoji. Remember, your opponent can see your face-up cards and may predict your moves. Also, don't forget about the Secret action. It can be a game-changer!"
