"Hello and welcome to Mobius Games! In this tutorial, we'll teach you how to play ABYSS..." [SHORT PAUSE] "Get ready, because we're off to dive into the deep, mystical sea kingdom!" [SHORT PAUSE]

Here's a quick introduction to ABYSS, a beautifully illustrated game published by Asmodee Games. With the main objective of gaining the most Influence Points, you'll be affiliating Allies, recruiting Lords, controlling Locations, and even slaying Monsters! This game is a fantastic adventure for 2 to 4 players, with an approximate game length of 60 minutes. It's suitable for ages 14 and up. [SHORT PAUSE]

Let's dive into the components and setup. [Image: Game components] Your ABYSS game comes with 71 exploration cards, 65 Allies from five different races, 6 Monster tokens, 35 Lords with unique abilities, and Location tiles to name just a few. You'll also find pearls, key tokens, and a game board. 

To set up the game, first place the game board in the center of the table. Then, shuffle the Exploration cards and place them face down on the Exploration Track. Arrange the Lords in a deck and place them next to the board, then reveal the top 5 Lords to create the Court. Place the pearls, keys, and monster tokens nearby and you're ready to begin! [SHORT PAUSE]

Now, let's talk about the goal of the game. Your main objective is to gain the most Influence Points (IP). To do this, you'll be performing actions like exploring depths to reveal Exploration cards, requesting support from the Council for Allies, recruiting Lords, and even battling Monsters. For example, if you manage to recruit a powerful Lord with a key symbol, that's a chance to control a new Location and score big points! [SHORT PAUSE]

On your turn, you can take several actions. You could choose to plot at Court by paying pearls to add a Lord to the Court. You might explore the depths to reveal Exploration cards, or request support from the Council to add all cards from one stack to your hand. But the key action you'll be taking is recruiting a Lord by playing enough Allies from your hand to meet the cost shown on the Lord card. So, remember, gathering Allies is as important as collecting seashells on a beach! [SHORT PAUSE]

The game ends when a player recruits their 7th Lord or when the Court cannot be filled with enough Lord cards. But don't worry, you'll all get one last chance to make a big splash with a final turn! [SHORT PAUSE]

Scoring is where the tide can turn. Points are gained from controlled Locations, recruited Lords, the strongest affiliated Ally from each race, and held Monster tokens. So if you've been a brave sea warrior and defeated a couple of Monsters, those tokens could be your winning tide! [SHORT PAUSE]
