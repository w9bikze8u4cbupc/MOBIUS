INTRODUCTION
[Show game box]
Welcome to the world of Hanamikoji, a beautiful and strategic card game where you compete to win the favor of illustrious Geishas. This game of art, music, dance, and ceremonies was designed by Kota Nakayama and brought to life with the elegant artwork of Maisherly Chan and Mashiro Misaki. Hanamikoji is a 2-player game that lasts about 15 minutes, making it a perfect quick game for an evening in.

COMPONENT OVERVIEW
[Show components]
This game comprises 7 Geisha cards, 8 Action markers, 21 Item cards, and 7 Victory markers. The Geisha cards represent the Geishas you are trying to win over, and the item cards represent the performance items that the Geishas excel in. Your action markers will be used to perform various actions throughout the game.

SETUP
[Show game setup]
To set up the game, place the 7 Geisha cards in a row between the players and put a Victory marker on the center of each Geisha card. Shuffle the item cards and deal each player 6 cards. The remaining item cards form a deck next to the row of Geishas. The youngest player goes first.

OBJECTIVE
[Show game box]
The aim of the game is to win the favor of 4 Geishas, or to accumulate 11 or more Charm points, represented by the item cards. You'll achieve this by performing actions and using your cards wisely.

GAMEPLAY FLOW
[Show gameplay]
The game is played over several rounds, each consisting of three phases: Deal, Action, and Scoring. During the Deal phase, you'll draw a card from the item deck. In the Action phase, you'll perform one of four possible actions using your action markers. In the Scoring phase, you'll reveal your secret card and compare the number of item cards on each side of each geisha.

KEY RULES & SPECIAL CASES
[Show gameplay]
There are four actions you can perform: Secret, Trade-off, Gift, and Competition. You'll use these actions to place cards on your side or your opponent's side of each Geisha. If one side has more cards than the other, that side wins the Geisha's favor. If both sides have the same number of cards, or no cards, the Victory Marker stays where it is. Remember, each action marker can only be used once per round.

EXAMPLE TURN
[Show gameplay example]
For example, let's say it's your turn and you decide to perform the "Gift" action. You choose three cards from your hand and place them face up in front of you. Your opponent then chooses one card to place on their side next to the corresponding Geisha. You then place the remaining two cards on your side next to the corresponding Geishas. These cards will be scored during the Scoring phase.

END GAME & SCORING
[Show scoring example]
The game ends immediately if any player wins the favor of 4 Geishas or accumulates 11 or more Charm points. If one player achieves both, the player with 11 or more Charm points is the winner. If neither player reaches the winning goal, the game proceeds to the next round.

TIPS/STRATEGY/COMMON MISTAKES
[Show game tips]
A common mistake in Hanamikoji is to focus solely on winning Geishas, forgetting about accumulating Charm points. Remember that a balance of both strategies can lead to victory. Also, try to keep track of which cards your opponent has played to predict their strategy.

VARIANTS & EXPANSIONS
