Hello and welcome to Mobius Games! In this tutorial, we'll teach you how to play Hanamikoji, where strategy and grace go hand in hand like a dance of cherry blossoms. Get ready, because we're about to step into the captivating world of Geisha masters! [SHORT PAUSE]

Hanamikoji is a beautifully crafted game for two players, published by EmperorS4. It's a contest of strategy and intuition as you and your opponent compete to win the favor of the Geisha masters by collecting performance items. A match lasts about 15 to 25 minutes, perfect for those tea breaks. The recommended age for this game is 10 and above, so it's a great game for families and friends alike! [SHORT PAUSE]

Now let's set the stage for our Geisha performance. We have seven Geisha Cards representing the masters of their arts, 21 Item Cards that you'll be collecting to win their favor, eight Action Markers, seven Victory Markers, one Secret Marker, and one Trade-off Marker. Start by shuffling the Item Cards and dealing six to each player. One card is removed from the pile unseen, adding a dash of mystery to the game. [Image: Dealt cards] [SHORT PAUSE]

Here's where the dance begins. Your goal is to either win the favor of four Geisha masters or earn 11 or more Charm Points. Each round is like a beautiful dance routine, consisting of the Deal, Action, and Scoring and Update phases. The Deal phase is where you receive your cards, and in the Action phase, you perform your moves, I mean, actions, to win the Geisha's favor. [SHORT PAUSE]

Speaking of actions, there are four that you can take: Secret, Trade-off, Gift, and Competition. Secret is like a hidden fan, where you hide a card for later scoring. Trade-off is a tactical bow, where you discard two cards. Gift is a gracious gesture, where you present three cards to your opponent who then chooses one. And Competition is a thrilling duel, where you present two sets of two cards and your opponent chooses one set. Remember, the order of your actions can be as important as the actions themselves! [SHORT PAUSE]

As the sun sets on our round, we move to the Scoring and Update phase. Here, players reveal their secret cards and compare the number of Item Cards for each Geisha. If you've managed to collect more items for a particular Geisha, congrats, you've won her favor! And if it's a tie, well, the Geisha remains neutral, waiting for the next round to decide. Each Geisha you win earns you Charm Points equal to her value. [SHORT PAUSE]

The game ends in a grand finale if a player manages to win the favor of 4 Geisha or earns 11 or more Charm Points. If not, the excitement continues with a new round! [SHORT PAUSE]
