Hello and welcome to Mobius Games! In this tutorial, we'll teach you how to play ABYSS... So, hold your breath because we're about to plunge into the deep, mysterious waters of a fantastical underwater kingdom! [SHORT PAUSE]

Abyss is a thrilling, fantasy-themed board game where players compete to become the King or Queen of Abyss. You'll do this by gaining the most Influence Points, or IPs, which you can earn through affiliating allies, recruiting lords, and controlling locations. You can also earn points by slaying monsters. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? This game is brought to you by Bombyx and Asmodee. [SHORT PAUSE]

Let's dive into the components and setup. Our underwater adventure includes a game board, 71 exploration cards, 35 Lords, 10 key tokens, 20 monster tokens, and 20 locations. You'll also find beautiful pearls, a threat token, varying amounts of location tiles, and plastic cups. 

To set up, start by giving the game board a good place in the center of the table. Shuffle the exploration and lord cards separately, then place the top cards in their designated spaces on the board. Each player then receives a pearl from the supply, which you can think of as your starting treasure. Now, who's ready to be the first to plunge into the Abyss? Decide on a starting player at random, and you're all set to go! [Image: Game board setup] [SHORT PAUSE]

Now, what's the goal of this game, you ask? Well, you're aiming to be crowned the ruler of Abyss by amassing the most IPs. You can gather IPs by affiliating allies, recruiting Lords, and controlling locations, or even by bravely vanquishing monsters. The game flows in turns, with each player plotting at court, then choosing one of three actions: Exploring the Depths, Requesting Support From the Council, or Recruiting a Lord. And if you manage to get a hold of a third key, you'll gain control of a location. [SHORT PAUSE]

On your turn, you have a menu of actions to choose from. You can explore the depths, where you'll reveal exploration cards that could be allies or monsters. Allies can be bought by other players, or you can add them to your hand. Monsters, on the other hand, are a bit more challenging. You can choose to fight them for rewards or keep exploring. You could also request support from the council or recruit a Lord. Remember, the order of your actions matters, so choose wisely! [SHORT PAUSE]

The game ends when there are no more Lords in the Court, or when a player recruits his seventh Lord. So, be sure to keep an eye on your fellow rulers and the Court! [SHORT PAUSE]

Now, let's talk points. After all, you can't rule the Abyss without them. Points are counted at the end of the game, tallying the IPs from your Lords, Keys, and controlled Locations. Extra points can also be earned for each Monster you've vanquished. [SHORT PAUSE]
