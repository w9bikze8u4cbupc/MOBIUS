# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to tighten the remaining gaps in the mobius-games-tutorial-generator project.

## 1. SSRF Allowlist Enforcement

### Changes Made
- Updated all URL validation endpoints to return 400 status codes with structured error codes
- Added `code: 'url_disallowed'` for all disallowed URL cases
- Echo X-Request-ID in error responses for traceability
- Added validation after fetch with redirect to re-validate final URL host

### Files Modified
- `src/api/index.js` - Updated URL validation in multiple endpoints

## 2. PDF Validation with Real File Tests

### Test Fixtures Created
- `tests/fixtures/small-valid.pdf` - Valid minimal PDF file
- `tests/fixtures/not-a-pdf.bin` - Invalid file with wrong content
- `tests/fixtures/big.pdf` - Oversized file (60KB)

### Error Codes Implemented
- `pdf_oversize` - For files exceeding size limits
- `pdf_bad_signature` - For files missing PDF signature
- `pdf_bad_mime` - For files with incorrect MIME type
- `pdf_parse_failed` - For general PDF parsing failures
- `pdf_upload_failed` - For upload failures

## 3. Retry-with-Jitter Implementation

### Changes Made
- Updated retry logic to use deterministic jitter (250ms/750ms)
- Added `/test-flaky` endpoint for validation testing
- Updated both BGG extraction and start-extraction endpoints

### Benefits
- Prevents retry storms with jittered backoff
- Respects server responses (no retry on 403)
- Improves success rate for rate-limited requests

## 4. ESLint Ratchet Plan

### Configuration Updates
- Focused on high-signal errors first:
  - `no-undef` - Error
  - `no-unused-vars` - Warning with ignore pattern
  - `no-empty` - Error
  - Security plugin violations - Error
  - Promise errors - Error

### Future Direction
- Gradually enable stylistic rules as warnings
- Add CI step with `npx eslint . --max-warnings=0`

## 5. Updated Validation Script

### Features
- Assertions for status codes and structured error codes
- Comprehensive test coverage for all validation scenarios
- Clear pass/fail reporting

## 6. Readiness Endpoint Improvements

### Enhancements
- Added worker pool ping timing
- Added BGG DNS resolve timing
- Enhanced logging with duration metrics

## 7. XML Fallback Caching

### Implementation
- Added 2-5 minute caching for XML fallback responses
- Reduces rate-limit exposure from BGG API
- Improves performance for repeated requests

## 8. Temp-file Cleanup Logging

### Improvement
- Added logging of file counts cleaned per sweep
- Better observability for cleanup operations

## Files Created
1. `tests/fixtures/small-valid.pdf` - Valid PDF test fixture
2. `tests/fixtures/not-a-pdf.bin` - Invalid PDF test fixture
3. `tests/fixtures/big.pdf` - Oversized PDF test fixture
4. `updated-validation.ps1` - Updated validation script with assertions
5. `test-retry-validation.js` - Retry validation test script

## Files Modified
1. `src/api/index.js` - Multiple endpoints updated for structured error responses
2. `eslint.config.js` - Updated ESLint configuration for ratchet approach

## Testing
All improvements have been implemented with proper error handling and validation. The updated validation script can be used to verify all functionality works as expected.
