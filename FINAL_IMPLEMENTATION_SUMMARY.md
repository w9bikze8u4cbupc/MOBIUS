# Final Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the complete implementation for image harvesting from Extra URLs and enhanced content parsing for board game components.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Image Harvesting from Extra URLs

#### Core Capabilities
- **HTML Parsing**: Uses Cheerio for robust DOM traversal and manipulation
- **URL Resolution**: Resolves relative URLs to absolute URLs for proper image fetching
- **Type Filtering**: Filters images by file type (png/jpg/webp) to ensure compatibility
- **Size Filtering**: Skips tiny icons with minimum size requirement of 120x120 pixels
- **Position Filtering**: Prioritizes images near "Components/Setup" sections with multilingual support
- **Content Filtering**: Filters by alt/title text for component-related keywords
- **Exclusion Filtering**: Excludes logos, icons, sprites, and social media images
- **Deduplication**: Normalizes URLs and removes duplicates, preferring highest-resolution variants
- **Ranking**: Ranks images by relevance to canonical component labels
- **Multiple Sources**: Supports multiple Extra URLs per game with sequential fallback

#### Multilingual Section Detection
Supports section headers in multiple languages:
- English: Components, Contents, Setup, Material
- Spanish: Componentes
- German: Inhalt
- French: Composants
- Italian: Materiali

#### Technical Implementation
- **Robust Fetching**: Implements timeout and error handling for HTTP requests
- **User-Agent**: Uses appropriate User-Agent header for better compatibility
- **Redirect Handling**: Follows redirects automatically
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes images one at a time to minimize memory usage

### 2. Enhanced Content Parsing

#### Multilingual Section Scoping
- Extended section detection to support multiple languages
- Improved fallback logic with confidence requirements
- Better end-of-section detection to avoid parsing rules text

#### OCR and Layout Resilience
- Enhanced OCR normalization for common confusions (l0rd→lord, etc.)
- Smart quote/dash normalization (en/em dashes to hyphens)
- Repeated word de-duplication ("Plastic Plastic Cups" → "Plastic Cups")
- Stray character normalization around counts (colons, dashes)

#### Breakdown Parsing and Validation
- Parse parenthetical details (e.g., "65 Allies & 6 Monsters")
- Handle multiplier formats (e.g., "2×4, 9×3, 9×2")
- Validate that subtype/multiplier sums match top-level counts
- Store breakdown information for downstream use

#### Verbose Triage and Debugging
- Standardized reason codes for all keep/drop decisions
- Dead-letter capture for excluded-but-suspicious lines
- Low-confidence fallback when section headers are missing
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

#### Game-Specific Support
- Added support for Hanamikoji components (Geisha cards, Item cards, etc.)
- Extensible synonym system for new games
- Canonical label management for consistency
