# FetchJson Implementation - Final Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improved implementation of the fetchJson utility and related components, incorporating all the recommended enhancements.

## Key Improvements

### 1. fetchJson.js Enhanced Features

- **Jittered Backoff**: Added random jitter to retry backoff to avoid thundering herd
- **429 Handling**: Explicit handling of 429 (Too Many Requests) with larger backoff or Retry-After header support
- **Max Timeout**: Added maxTimeout option to cap total retry time
- **Improved Deduplication**: Better dedupe fingerprinting using method+url+action
- **Response Metadata**: Expose response metadata (timings, attempt count) on success for telemetry
- **Error Handling**: When JSON parse fails for error responses, include raw text in backend error for debugging

### 2. DevTestPage.jsx Improvements

- **Environment Gating**: Ensures REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST gating is read at boot
- **Accessibility**: Added ARIA attributes and proper keyboard focus handling
- **Testability**: Added data-testid attributes for reliable Playwright selectors
- **Reset Functionality**: Exposed explicit "reset" button for test state
- **Safety**: Ensures DevTestPage cannot be shipped enabled by default

### 3. Jest Test Enhancements

- **Fake Timers**: Used fake timers (jest.useFakeTimers()) to avoid long sleeps during retry testing
- **Retry Behavior**: Added tests that mock fetch with different sequential responses to assert retry behavior
- **Dedupe Testing**: Added tests that spy on toast.addToast to ensure it's called once for repeated errors
- **Concurrency Testing**: Added tests for concurrent deduplication by resolving multiple fetches simultaneously

### 4. Playwright E2E Test Improvements

- **Deterministic Selectors**: Used data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
- **Artifact Capture**: Added screenshot capture on failure for CI debugging
- **Accessibility Testing**: Added tests for proper ARIA attributes and keyboard handling
- **Flake Mitigation**: Improved timing and wait strategies to reduce test flakiness

## Implementation Files

1. `fetchJson-improved.js` - Enhanced fetchJson utility with all recommended improvements
2. `DevTestPage-improved.jsx` - Improved DevTestPage with better accessibility and testability
3. `extractBggHtml-improved.test.js` - Enhanced Jest tests with fake timers and deduplication testing
4. `searchImages-improved.test.js` - Enhanced Jest tests with fake timers and deduplication testing
5. `toast-dedupe-improved.spec.ts` - Improved Playwright tests with better selectors and artifact capture
6. `qa-gating-improved.spec.ts` - Improved Playwright tests with accessibility verification

## CI/CD Considerations

- **Artifact Uploads**: All Playwright tests now capture screenshots for debugging failed tests
- **Reliable Selectors**: Used data-testid attributes throughout for stable element selection
- **Flake Mitigation**: Implemented proper wait strategies and retry logic
- **Accessibility Testing**: Added tests to verify ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## Migration Notes

When migrating to these improved versions:

1. Update the fetchJson import paths in your API helpers
2. Modify API helpers to handle the new response format (data wrapped in object with metadata)
3. Update Jest tests to account for the new response format
4. Add data-testid attributes to your existing components for better testability
5. Update Playwright tests to use the new selectors

## Next Steps

1. Migrate existing codebase to use the improved fetchJson implementation
2. Update all related tests to match the new interfaces
3. Add comprehensive documentation for the new features
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Monitor for performance and reliability improvements
