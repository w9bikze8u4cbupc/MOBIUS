# Axios to fetchJson Migration - Final Report

## Summary
This report details the successful migration from axios to a custom fetchJson utility across the mobius-games-tutorial-generator project. The migration was completed with minimal disruption and provides significant improvements in error handling, reliability, and user experience.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Core Utility Implementation
- **fetchJson.js**: Created a robust fetch utility with:
  - Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
  - AbortSignal support for cancellations
  - Centralized error mapping and user-friendly messaging
  - Toast notification integration with deduplication
  - Support for authentication headers and custom configurations

### 2. API Helper Modules
Created dedicated API helper modules for all endpoints:
- `extractBggHtmlDirect.js` - Direct BGG HTML extraction
- `extractComponents.js` - PDF component extraction
- `extractExtraImages.js` - Extra image extraction
- `fetchBggImages.js` - BGG image fetching
- `generateStoryboard.js` - Storyboard generation
- `generateTts.js` - Text-to-speech generation
- `saveProject.js` - Project saving
- `summarizeText.js` - Text summarization
- `uploadPdf.js` - PDF uploading

### 3. Component Updates
- **App.jsx**: Fixed duplicate imports and syntax errors
- **App.jsx**: Migrated all axios calls to use new API helpers
- **ToastContext.js**: Enhanced with deduplication capabilities
- **errorMap.js**: Created comprehensive error mapping utility

### 4. Dependency Management
- Removed axios from `package.json` dependencies
- Cleaned up all axios imports from the codebase

### 5. Documentation and Tools
- Created migration summary documentation
- Created codemod script for future axios migrations
- Created Jest mock examples for testing
- Created PR template for future migrations

## Migration Benefits

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Centralized error mapping with user-friendly messages
- Automatic toast notifications with deduplication
- Better error context for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Reliability
- Built-in retry with exponential backoff
- AbortSignal support for cancellations
- Better handling of network issues

### 3. Better User Experience
- Consistent toast notifications
- Deduplication to prevent duplicate error messages
- Improved loading states and feedback

### 4. Code Quality
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Centralized API calls in dedicated modules
- Better separation of concerns

## Files Modified

### Client-side Files
- `client/src/App.jsx` - Migrated all axios calls to fetchJson helpers
- `client/src/api/*.js` - Created new API helper modules
- `client/src/utils/fetchJson.js` - Core fetch utility
- `client/src/utils/errorMap.js` - Error mapping utility
- `client/src/contexts/ToastContext.js` - Enhanced with deduplication
- `client/package.json` - Removed axios dependency

### Artifact Files
- `artifacts/MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Migration documentation
- `artifacts/axios-to-fetchjson-codemod.js` - Codemod script for future migrations
- `artifacts/jest-mock-examples.js` - Jest mock examples
- `artifacts/PR_TEMPLATE.md` - PR template for future migrations

## Testing
- Updated existing tests to mock fetch instead of axios
- Added tests for retry/backoff behavior using fake timers
- Added tests to assert dedupe behavior
- Added tests for AbortSignal during backoff

## Rollback Plan
If issues are detected after deployment:
1. Revert the PR
2. Reinstall axios: `npm install axios`
3. Restore axios imports in affected files
4. Re-deploy the previous version

## Next Steps
1. Monitor error rates and user feedback for the first 24-72 hours
2. Add telemetry for fetchJson usage (attempts, elapsedMs, Retry-After usage)
3. Migrate any remaining axios usages in other parts of the codebase
4. Update team documentation with concrete examples and best practices

## Conclusion
The migration from axios to fetchJson has been successfully completed. The new utility provides better error handling, automatic retries, toast deduplication, and improved reliability compared to direct axios usage. The codebase is now more maintainable with centralized API calls and better separation of concerns.
