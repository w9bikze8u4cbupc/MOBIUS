# FetchJson Final Implementation - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the final implementation of the fetchJson utility with all the recommended improvements and fixes.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. In-flight Deduplication with Proper Lifecycle Management

- Added module-level Map to track in-flight requests
- Implemented proper cleanup in finally blocks to prevent memory leaks
- Ensured dedupe entries are always removed on success, failure, or abort

### 2. Abortable Backoff Sleep

- Implemented sleepAbortable helper function that respects AbortSignal
- Ensured backoff waiting can be cancelled if the caller aborts
- Properly propagates AbortError immediately when aborted

### 3. Enhanced Retry-After Handling

- Added parseRetryAfter helper function to handle both numeric and HTTP-date formats
- Prefer Retry-After header when present
- Fall back to exponential backoff with jitter when header is absent

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- Added backendRaw property to error objects for debugging when JSON parsing fails
- Included attempt count and timing information in error objects
- Properly handled non-JSON responses

### 5. Enhanced Telemetry

- Exposed timing and attempt count in successful responses
- Added telemetry information to error objects

## Final Implementation Files

1. `fetchJson-final.js` - Complete fetchJson implementation with all improvements
2. `fetchJson-final.test.js` - Comprehensive Jest tests covering:
   - Successful requests with metadata
   - Retry behavior with fake timers
   - 429 handling with Retry-After header
   - Concurrent deduplication
   - AbortSignal handling during backoff
   - JSON parse error handling
   - Non-JSON response handling
3. `github-actions-final.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow with:
   - Proper Playwright browser installation
   - Artifact uploads for test results and screenshots
   - Trace collection on first retry

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ In-flight dedupe entries are always removed (success, failure, abort)
✅ Backoff waiting respects AbortSignal
✅ Unit tests cover:
  - Retries behavior with fake timers
  - Retry-After header handling
  - Concurrent dedupe behavior
  - Abort during backoff
✅ Playwright tests use data-testid selectors and upload artifacts on failure
✅ CI workflow installs Playwright browsers and runs playwright install
✅ README updated with fetchJson options and dedupe caveats

## Migration Notes

When migrating to this final implementation:

1. Update import paths to use the new fetchJson-final.js
2. Handle the new response format (data wrapped in object with metadata)
3. Update error handling to account for new error properties
4. Ensure all API helpers are updated to work with the new interface

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the final implementation into the codebase
2. Update all related tests to match the new interfaces
3. Add comprehensive documentation for the new features
4. Monitor CI for test stability and performance
5. Add observability for the telemetry data
