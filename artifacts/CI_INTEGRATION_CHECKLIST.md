# QA Checklist for CI Integration

## Playwright Tests in CI

- [ ] Configure Playwright GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`
- [ ] Set up parallel test execution for faster feedback
- [ ] Configure test retries for flaky test mitigation (typically 1-2 retries)
- [ ] Ensure proper browser setup (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit if needed)
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables for CI testing
- [ ] Configure test timeouts appropriately (default is usually sufficient)

## Test Artifact Uploads

- [ ] Configure artifact upload for test results (JUnit XML format)
- [ ] Set up screenshot uploads on test failures for visual debugging
- [ ] Configure trace file uploads for detailed failure analysis
- [ ] Ensure artifacts are retained for appropriate duration (e.g., 30 days)
- [ ] Set up proper artifact naming conventions for easy identification

## Flaky Test Mitigation

- [ ] Identify and mark known flaky tests with appropriate annotations
- [ ] Implement proper wait strategies instead of fixed timeouts
- [ ] Use unique test data to avoid test interdependencies
- [ ] Ensure proper test isolation (no shared state between tests)
- [ ] Implement retry logic for network-dependent tests
- [ ] Add detailed logging for failure analysis

## Environment Configuration

- [ ] Set up separate test environments for CI (staging, test, etc.)
- [ ] Configure proper database seeding for tests
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are properly set in CI
- [ ] Set up mock services where appropriate to reduce dependencies
- [ ] Configure proper cleanup between test runs

## Monitoring and Reporting

- [ ] Set up test result reporting to Slack or email on failures
- [ ] Configure test duration monitoring to identify performance regressions
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting as part of CI pipeline
- [ ] Implement proper tagging for test categorization (smoke, regression, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerts for test suite failures

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Optimize test execution time (parallelization, selective test runs)
- [ ] Implement proper test data cleanup to prevent test environment bloat
- [ ] Monitor resource usage during test execution
- [ ] Set up proper caching for dependencies to speed up builds
- [ ] Configure appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging tests

## Security and Compliance

- [ ] Ensure test data does not contain sensitive information
- [ ] Configure proper access controls for test artifacts
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management for test environments
- [ ] Ensure compliance with data retention policies for test artifacts
- [ ] Set up proper audit logging for test execution
