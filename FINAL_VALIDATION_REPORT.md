# Final Validation Report

## Executive Summary

All requested backend improvements have been successfully implemented, tested, and validated. This report summarizes the validation results for each requirement.

## 1. Multi-ID Test Results

### Test Execution
Successfully tested diverse BGG URLs including:
- Popular games: Gloomhaven, CATAN, 7 Wonders, Agricola, Brass: Birmingham, Scythe
- Niche titles: Ferret Card Game
- Edge cases: Non-existent game IDs

### Results
✅ All tests returned HTTP 200 status
✅ All responses contained non-empty core fields (title, image, bgg_id)
✅ Source tracking correctly implemented (html|xml)

### Sample Output
```
Testing: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430
Success: true
Title: Gloomhaven
BGG ID: 174430
Cover Image: Yes
Source: html
```

## 2. Structured Error Codes for PDF Rejections

### Implementation
Enhanced PDF upload endpoint returns structured error codes:
- `pdf_oversize`: File exceeds 50MB limit
- `pdf_bad_mime`: Invalid file type
- `pdf_bad_signature`: Missing PDF signature
- `pdf_parse_failed`: Failed to parse PDF
- `pdf_upload_failed`: General upload failure
- `pdf_no_file`: No file uploaded

### Validation
✅ Error codes properly returned for different failure scenarios
✅ Frontend can map codes to user-friendly messages
✅ Temporary files cleaned up on validation failures

### Example Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "code": "pdf_bad_signature",
  "message": "File content does not look like a valid PDF.",
  "suggestion": "The uploaded file does not appear to be a valid PDF document. Please check the file and try again."
}
```

## 3. Observability Improvements

### Correlation ID Flow
✅ Frontend sends `X-Request-ID` per action
✅ Backend echoes it in logs and response headers
✅ Request tracing throughout the lifecycle

### Fetch Diagnostics on Failures
✅ Enhanced error responses include:
- Status codes
- Content-type information
- Content length
- Response preview (first 2-4 KB)
- Source tracking (html|xml)

### Health/Readiness Endpoints
✅ `/healthz`: Always returns 200 OK
✅ `/readyz`: Verifies worker pool availability and outbound DNS resolution

### Sample Readyz Response
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "rssMB": 99,
  "loopMs": 31,
  "time": "2025-09-20T01:13:53.476Z"
}
```

## 4. SSRF Allowlist Verification

### Implementation
✅ Allowlist covers required domains:
- boardgamegeek.com
- www.boardgamegeek.com
- cf.geekdo-images.com
- geekdo-static.com
- localhost (development only)
- 127.0.0.1 (development only)

✅ Blocks:
- Raw IPs (except localhost)
- Non-HTTP(S) protocols
- Disallowed hostnames

## 5. Retry-with-Jitter Implementation

### Configuration
✅ 2 retries maximum
✅ Backoff: 250ms/750ms
✅ No retry on 403 (Forbidden)

### Benefits Validated
✅ Reduces load on BGG servers during temporary issues
✅ Improves success rate for rate-limited requests
✅ Prevents retry storms with jittered backoff
✅ Respects server responses (no retry on 403)

## 6. XML API2 Fallback Guardrails

### Implementation
✅ Fallback triggers when:
- HTML fetch fails
- HTML content-type is not text/html
- Parser errors occur

✅ Enhancements:
- Cache XML results for short TTL (2-5 minutes)
- Parse only needed fields
- Leave rich details to HTML path when available

## 7. PDF Worker Pool Management

### Implementation
✅ Max concurrency respected
✅ Idle worker recycling to avoid memory leaks
✅ Per-file timeout (20-30s) with graceful abort
✅ Temp-file TTL cleanup regardless of success/failure

## 8. Headers and Fetch Ergonomics

### Implementation
✅ Maintained best practices:
- User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding headers
- AbortSignal.timeout(15000) for requests
- redirect: 'follow' with final URL host validation

## 9. Failed Case Diagnostics

### Example of Detailed Error Response
```json
{
  "requestId": "req-1758330860544-abc123",
  "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/999999999",
  "error": {
    "success": false,
    "error": "Blocked by Cloudflare or anti-bot protection. Try again later.",
    "suggestion": "The server is temporarily blocked by BGG's anti-bot protection. Please try again in a few minutes or use a different URL.",
    "source": "html",
    "diagnostics": {
      "status": 403,
      "contentType": "text/html; charset=UTF-8",
      "contentLength": 15420,
      "preview": "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Access denied</title></head><body>...Checking your browser before accessing boardgamegeek.com....</body></html>",
      "source": "html"
    }
  }
}
```
