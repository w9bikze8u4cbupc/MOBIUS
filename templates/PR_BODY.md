  }
}
```

## Deployment Plan

### Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - [ ] Create backup: `./scripts/backup_dhash.sh --env production`
   - [ ] Verify backup integrity
   - [ ] Send pre-deployment notification

2. **Deployment Execution**  
   - [ ] Run deployment: `./quick-deploy.sh production`
   - [ ] Execute migrations (if any)
   - [ ] Validate deployment success

3. **Post-deployment**
   - [ ] Monitor for 60 minutes (automatic)
   - [ ] Run smoke tests
   - [ ] Validate quality gates
   - [ ] Send completion notification

### Rollback Plan

**Rollback command (if needed):**
```bash
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)
./scripts/rollback_dhash.sh --backup "$LATEST_BACKUP" --env production --force
```

**Rollback triggers:**
- Quality gate violations detected
- Critical smoke test failures  
- Manual operator decision
- Automatic monitoring alerts

## Approvals Required

- [ ] **Deploy Operator (@ops):** Reviewed artifacts and provided explicit sign-off
- [ ] **SRE Team (≥1 member):** Approved deployment plan and rollback procedures
- [ ] **Code Review (≥1 approver):** Code changes reviewed and approved
- [ ] **Security Review:** (if security-related changes) Security team approval

**Deploy Operator Sign-off:**
> @ops: I have reviewed all deployment artifacts and approve this deployment. Backup verification complete, monitoring thresholds appropriate, rollback plan confirmed.

**SRE Approval:**
> @sre-team: SRE review complete. Quality gates configured appropriately, monitoring coverage sufficient, emergency procedures verified.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High [ ] Critical

**Risk Factors:**
- [ ] First-time deployment of new component
- [ ] Database schema changes
- [ ] External service dependencies
- [ ] Peak traffic deployment window  
- [ ] Limited rollback window
- [ ] Cross-service dependencies

**Mitigation Strategies:**
<!-- Describe specific mitigations for identified risks -->

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Testing
- [ ] **Unit tests:** All passing
- [ ] **Integration tests:** All passing  
- [ ] **Staging deployment:** Successfully completed
- [ ] **Canary deployment:** (if applicable) Completed with no issues
- [ ] **Load testing:** (if applicable) Performance validated

### Post-deployment Validation
- [ ] **Smoke tests:** Critical tier + standard tier
- [ ] **Health checks:** 3 consecutive OK checks required
- [ ] **Performance monitoring:** P95 latency, error rates, throughput
- [ ] **Quality gates:** All thresholds monitored for 60 minutes

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Notifications

**Pre-deployment:**
- [ ] Engineering teams notified
- [ ] Operations teams notified  
- [ ] Customer success (if customer-facing changes)

**During deployment:**
- [ ] Real-time updates via configured channels
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Escalation paths established

**Post-deployment:**
- [ ] Success notification sent
- [ ] Performance summary provided
- [ ] Any issues documented

### Notification Channels

- **Slack:** `#deployments-prod` (primary), `#alerts-prod` (alerts)
- **Email:** [deployment notification list]
- **Teams:** [if configured]
- **Discord:** [if configured]

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Quality Gate Configuration

Current production thresholds:
- **Health failures:** >2 consecutive non-OK checks → auto-rollback
- **Extraction failure rate:** >5% over 10 minutes → auto-rollback  
- **P95 hash time:** >2000ms over 15 minutes → auto-rollback
- **Queue length:** >1000 items → auto-rollback

### Monitoring Duration
- **Primary monitoring:** 60 minutes post-deployment
- **Extended monitoring:** 4 hours (manual observation)
- **Polling frequency:** 30s initial phase (5min), then 120s regular

### Alert Escalation
1. **T+0:** Automatic quality gate monitoring starts
2. **T+15min:** First escalation if issues detected  
3. **T+30min:** SRE escalation if unresolved
4. **T+60min:** Monitoring complete, final status report

## Dependencies

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (T+0 to T+4 hours)
- [ ] Monitor quality gates and system health
- [ ] Verify notification delivery
- [ ] Review monitoring logs for anomalies
- [ ] Confirm backup availability for emergency rollback

### Short-term (T+4 to T+24 hours)

- [ ] Archive logs and artifacts
- [ ] Performance analysis and comparison to baseline
- [ ] Customer impact assessment (if applicable)

### Long-term (T+24 to T+72 hours)
- [ ] Fine-tune quality gate thresholds based on production telemetry
- [ ] Update operational documentation
- [ ] Post-deployment retrospective (if issues occurred)
- [ ] Backup retention policy enforcement
