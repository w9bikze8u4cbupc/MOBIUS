# Abyss Component Extraction Fix - Summary

## Problem
The component extraction system was producing an overly long list of components for the Abyss board game PDF, including many false positives such as reward text, examples, and figure captions. This was caused by:

1. **Section scope drift**: Parser scanning entire rulebook instead of constraining to "Contents & Setup" section
2. **Over-broad numeric patterns**: Catching examples and rules text
3. **Image alt/captions bleed**: Figure captions treated as components

## Solution
Implemented targeted hotfix with three guardrails in `src/api/utils.js`:

### 1. Hard Scope to Components Section
- **Start anchor**: Headers like "Contents & Setup", "Components", "Box Contents", "Game Components"
- **End anchor**: Sections like "Object of the Game", "Game Overview", "1 Plot at Court", "Setup ends"

### 2. Strict Allowlist on Nouns + Number Parsing
- Only accept core component nouns: cards, tokens, tiles, board, key(s), pearl(s), cup(s), etc.
- Accept colon lines and "Place the..." patterns
- Explicitly normalize terms (Lords → Lord cards, Locations → Location tiles, etc.)
- Exclude reward text, steps, examples, captions

### 3. Collapse Examples into Parent Decks
- Drop individual card names when parent deck is detected
- Handle "front/back" captions and example itemizations

## Results

### Before Fix
- 50+ components including false positives
- "Only cards" issue (majority were card-related)
- False positives like "On The 6Th Space, They Win 2 Pearls"

### After Fix
- Exactly 9 correct components:
  1. Game board — 1
  2. Exploration cards — 71 (65 Allies & 6 Monsters)
  3. Lord cards — 35
  4. Location tiles — 20
  5. Monster tokens — 20 (2 of value 4, 9 of value 3, 9 of value 2)
  6. Threat token — 1
  7. Key tokens — 10
  8. Pearls — null (supply)
  9. Plastic cups — null (Treasury)
- No false positives
- Multiple component types detected (boards, cards, tokens, lords, locations, monsters, pearls, cups)
- "Only cards" issue RESOLVED

## Files Modified
1. `src/api/utils.js` - Complete rewrite of `extractComponentsFromText` function

3. Added new test files:
   - `test-abyss-fix.js` - Basic validation test
   - `test-abyss-comprehensive.js` - Comprehensive validation
   - `test-abyss-regression.js` - Regression test
   - `debug-abyss.js` - Debugging tool
   - `debug-pearls.js` - Specific debugging for Pearls component
   - `debug-pearls2.js` - Additional debugging for Pearls component

## Verification
All tests pass:
- ✅ 9/9 components correctly extracted
