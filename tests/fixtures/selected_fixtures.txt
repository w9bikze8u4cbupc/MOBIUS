Use these uploaded PDFs as CI/local fixtures for the ingestion POC (do NOT commit copyrighted PDFs to a public repo).

Preferred initial fixtures (private/internal repo):
- Wingspan.Rules.en.pdf
- The-Isle-of-Cats.pdf

Optional additional fixtures (for later iterations):
- f9-the-castles-of-burgundy-rulebook.pdf
- Hanamikoji.pdf
- ABYSS.pdf
- Jaipur.pdf
- a5-viticulture-essential-edition-rulebook.pdf

Notes:
- For public/open-source builds, replace with synthetic or redacted fixtures.
- If CI needs OCR tests, run them in a Docker job that has tesseract & pdftoppm installed.
