### Guarded dhash Rollout — Operator Quick Reference

#### Purpose
Safe, one-command guarded rollouts for dhash with pre-merge validation, backup verification, T+60 monitoring with quality gates, auto-rollback, manual rollback, and notification usage.

#### Prerequisites
- Deploy operator credentials and GitHub permissions.  
- CI passing for the PR (premerge.yml artifacts available).  
- Backups present in backups/ with matching .sha256 files.  
- Secrets (SLACK_WEBHOOK, TEAMS_WEBHOOK, EMAIL creds) stored in GitHub Actions secrets.  
- Local tools: bash (POSIX), Node 18+ for notify.js, sha256sum (or equivalent).

#### Quick safety checklist
- [ ] Attach artifacts: backups/*.zip + .sha256, deploy-dryrun.log, migrate-dryrun.log, postdeploy-smoketests.log, test_logging.log, premerge_artifacts/, monitor_logs/, CI links.  
- [ ] Premerge CI green on all platforms.  
- [ ] Branch protection in place (2 approvers, ≥1 Ops/SRE).  
- [ ] Deploy operator (@ops) signs off.

#### Create PR
- Paste PR_BODY.md content as the PR description.  
- Add explicit merge note: MERGE_NOW approved with guarded rollout — rebase-and-merge after gates pass.

#### Merge strategy
- Use rebase-and-merge for a linear history.  
- Do not merge until checklist items and @ops sign-off are complete.

#### One-command production deploy
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh --env production
