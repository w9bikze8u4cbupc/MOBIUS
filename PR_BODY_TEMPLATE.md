# MOBIUS Deployment Framework - PR Body Content

## Paste-ready one-paragraph PR summary

This PR implements a complete deployment readiness framework for MOBIUS, providing modular deployment scripts, a multi-OS pre-merge CI pipeline with artifact uploads and PR comments, production runbooks and notification templates (Slack & Teams), enforced branch protection and approval policies, and conservative T+60 monitoring + auto-rollback defaults. The framework standardizes guarded rebase-and-merge rollouts, requires mandatory pre-merge gates (backups, dry-runs, migration dry-runs, smoke tests), and provides verified rollback and observability tooling for safe production deployments.

## What this PR delivers (short bullet list)

â€¢ Modular scripts (scripts/deploy/): backup, premerge_orchestration, deploy_dryrun, migration_dryrun, smoke_tests, monitor, rollback, lcm_export.
â€¢ CI: .github/workflows/premerge-validation.yml â€” multi-OS matrix, artifact uploads, PR comments, vulnerability scanning.
â€¢ Runbooks & templates: runbooks/deployment_runbook.md, runbooks/rollback_runbook.md, notification templates (Slack/Teams).
â€¢ Safety defaults: 60-minute monitoring window, conservative auto-rollback triggers, SHA256-verified backups, dry-run support.
â€¢ Policy: rebase-and-merge enforced; require â‰¥2 approvers including â‰¥1 Ops/SRE; Deploy operator sign-off required.

## Paste-ready PR checklist (copy into PR body as checkboxes)

- [ ] Attach backups/*.zip and corresponding .sha256 files
- [ ] Attach deploy-dryrun.log and migration-dryrun.log  
- [ ] Attach postdeploy-smoketests.log and test_logging.log
- [ ] Attach premerge_artifacts/ CI bundle and links to CI runs (Ubuntu / macOS / Windows)
- [ ] Attach monitor_logs/ from staging/canary dry-run (if available)
- [ ] CI: premerge-validation workflow succeeded and artifacts uploaded
- [ ] Branch protection contexts configured and passing for required checks
- [ ] 2 approvers (â‰¥1 Ops/SRE) have approved this PR
- [ ] Deploy operator (@ops) has signed off for guarded merge

## Operator quick commands â€” copy/paste

```bash
# Identify latest verified backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)
sha256sum -c "${LATEST_BACKUP}.sha256"

# Emergency rollback (after verification)
./scripts/deploy/rollback_dhash.sh --backup "$LATEST_BACKUP" --env production

# Start monitoring (60 minutes) with auto-rollback
MONITOR_DURATION=3600 AUTO_ROLLBACK=true ./scripts/deploy/monitor.sh &

# Post-rollback verification
./scripts/deploy/smoke_tests.sh --env production
# Require 3 consecutive OK health checks per runbook
```

## Key auto-rollback thresholds (conservative defaults)

â€¢ **3 consecutive health check failures** â†’ trigger rollback.
â€¢ **Overall success rate < 70%** after â‰¥5 checks â†’ trigger rollback.
â€¢ **p95 latency > 5000 ms** consistently â†’ trigger rollback.
â€¢ **Error rate > 5%** â†’ trigger rollback.
