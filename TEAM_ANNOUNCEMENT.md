## ðŸš€ Frontend Stability Improvements Deployed

Hi team, I'm excited to announce that we've significantly improved the stability of our frontend development workflow with several key enhancements:

### âœ¨ What's New

**Environment Variable Standardization**
- Centralized `REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST` access through a new helper utility
- Added ESLint rule to prevent direct `process.env` usage
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

**Robust WebSocket Handling**
- Introduced `WebSocketGuard` with exponential backoff and jitter
- Eliminates noisy reconnection spam during development
- More reliable WebSocket connections in dev and potentially prod scenarios

**Deterministic Tests**
- Fixed flaky WebSocket tests that were causing CI instability
- Implemented proper Jest teardown to prevent hanging tests
- All tests now run consistently and quickly

### ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters

These changes directly address several pain points:
- No more WebSocket reconnect spam during HMR
- CI is more reliable with deterministic tests
- Development experience is smoother and faster
- Better code quality through linting enforcement

### ðŸ“‹ Quick Validation

To verify these changes locally:
```bash
cd client
npm ci
npm run lint
npx jest client/src/utils/__tests__/WebSocketGuard.test.js --verbose
npm run dev
```

Check that:
1. No lint errors appear
2. All WebSocketGuard tests pass quickly
3. Dev server starts without WebSocket spam
4. Dev test toggle still works correctly

### ðŸ“ž Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues after pulling these changes, please reach out in #frontend or message me directly. Documentation has been updated in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with detailed debugging steps.

Thanks for your continued great work!
