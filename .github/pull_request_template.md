## Summary

## Testing
- [ ] `npm test`

## ARC & Golden Troubleshooting
- [ ] I reviewed ARC & golden diffs as needed
- [ ] If ARC masks were added or modified, I confirmed:
      - mask schema is valid (`validate-arc-semantic` passes)
      - mask shapes match the intended dynamic regions
      - mask platforms (any/macos/windows/linux) are correct
      - SSIM results after masking match expectations
