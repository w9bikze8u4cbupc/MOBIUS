## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Required Artifacts

Before deploying to production, ensure all required artifacts are present and validated:

#### 1. Backup Verification
```bash
# List available backups
ls -la backups/dhash_*.zip

# Verify latest backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)
sha256sum -c "${LATEST_BACKUP}.sha256"
```

#### 2. Dry-Run Logs
Ensure these log files are present in `premerge_artifacts/logs/`:
- `backup-dryrun.log`
- `deploy-dryrun.log`
- `migrate-dryrun.log`
- `postdeploy-smoketests.log`
- `test_logging.log`

#### 3. CI Validation
- [ ] Pre-merge GitHub Actions workflow passed (`.github/workflows/premerge.yml`)
- [ ] Cross-platform CI validation completed (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] All quality gates configuration validated

#### 4. Approval Requirements
- [ ] Deploy operator (@ops) has reviewed artifacts and given explicit sign-off
- [ ] At least 2 approvers including â‰¥1 Ops/SRE team member
- [ ] Branch protection rules satisfied

### Environment Preparation

#### Production Environment Setup
```bash
# Verify environment configuration
node -e "console.log(require('./quality-gates-config.json').environments.production)"

# Check service health before deployment
curl -s https://dhash.production.example.com/health

# Verify monitoring tools are available
node scripts/monitor_dhash.js --env production --dry-run --duration-minutes 1
```

#### Dependencies and Platform Requirements

##### Linux/macOS Dependencies
- `curl` (for health checks and API calls)
- `node` v16+ (for monitoring and notification scripts)
- `zip/unzip` (for backup operations)
- `sha256sum` (for backup verification)

##### Windows Dependencies
- PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 7+
- `curl.exe` (included in Windows 10/11)
- Node.js v16+ (downloadable from nodejs.org)
- 7-Zip or Windows built-in ZIP support

##### Optional Dependencies
- `ffmpeg` (if media processing is involved)
- `poppler-utils` (for PDF processing, if applicable)

To install missing dependencies on Windows:
```powershell
# Install Node.js (run as Administrator)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS

# Install 7-Zip (optional, for better ZIP handling)
winget install 7zip.7zip
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment Backup

Always create a backup before deployment:

```bash
# Create production backup
./scripts/backup_dhash.sh --env production

# Verify backup was created successfully
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_production_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)
echo "Created backup: $LATEST_BACKUP"
sha256sum -c "${LATEST_BACKUP}.sha256"
```

### 2. Migration Execution (if required)

Run database migrations:

```bash
# Run migration dry-run first
./scripts/migrate_dhash.sh --dry-run --env production

# Execute actual migration
./scripts/migrate_dhash.sh --env production
```

### 3. Application Deployment

Deploy the application:

```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy_dhash.sh --env production

# The script will automatically:
# 1. Create pre-deployment backup
# 2. Stop dhash service
# 3. Update application code
# 4. Update configuration
# 5. Start dhash service
# 6. Run post-deployment verification
# 7. Start 60-minute monitoring
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

The deployment script automatically runs verification, but you can run manual checks:

```bash
# Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke_tests.sh --env production

# Validate logging
node scripts/validate_logging.js --env production

# Check service health
curl -s https://dhash.production.example.com/health
```

## Monitoring and Quality Gates

### Automatic Monitoring

After production deployment, a 60-minute monitoring period begins automatically:

- **Initial 5 minutes**: High-frequency polling (every 30 seconds)
- **Remaining 55 minutes**: Normal polling (every 2 minutes)

### Quality Gate Thresholds

The monitoring system checks these thresholds (configured in `quality-gates-config.json`):

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Health check failures | >2 consecutive | Auto-rollback |
| Extraction failure rate | >5% over 10min | Auto-rollback |
| P95 hash time | >2000ms over 15min | Auto-rollback |
| Low confidence queue length | >1000 items | Auto-rollback |

### Manual Monitoring

You can monitor the deployment manually:

```bash
# Check monitoring status
ps aux | grep monitor_dhash

# View real-time monitor logs
tail -f monitor_logs/monitor_$(date +%Y%m%d)*.log

# Check current metrics
curl -s https://dhash.production.example.com/metrics
```

### Monitoring Notifications

Notifications are sent via:
- Slack (if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` configured)
- Discord (if `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` configured)
- Microsoft Teams (if `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` configured)
- Console output (always enabled)

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

If quality gates fail, the system will automatically trigger rollback:

1. Monitoring detects threshold violation
2. Auto-rollback executes using latest backup
3. Service is restored to previous state
4. Critical notifications are sent
5. Incident is flagged for manual investigation

### Manual Rollback

If you need to trigger rollback manually:

#### Quick Rollback (Latest Backup)
```bash
# Rollback to latest backup
./scripts/rollback_dhash.sh --env production --reason "manual-intervention"
```

#### Specific Backup Rollback
```bash
# List available backups
ls -la backups/dhash_production_*.zip

# Rollback to specific backup
./scripts/rollback_dhash.sh --env production \
  --backup backups/dhash_production_20240325_120000.zip \
  --reason "rollback-to-known-good-state"
```

### Post-Rollback Verification

After rollback, verify system health:

```bash
# Wait for service to stabilize
sleep 30

# Run health checks (requires 3 consecutive OK)
for i in {1..3}; do
  echo "Health check $i/3:"
  curl -s https://dhash.production.example.com/health
  sleep 10
done

# Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke_tests.sh --env production

# Check metrics
curl -s https://dhash.production.example.com/metrics
```

## Incident Response

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Deployment Script Fails
```bash
# Check logs
cat deploy_logs/deploy_$(date +%Y%m%d)*.log

# Verify prerequisites
./scripts/deploy_dhash.sh --dry-run --env production

# Manual service check
systemctl status dhash
# or
docker ps | grep dhash
```

#### 2. Monitoring Not Starting
```bash
# Check if process is running
ps aux | grep monitor_dhash

# Check for PID file issues
ls -la /tmp/dhash_monitor.pid

# Restart monitoring manually
node scripts/monitor_dhash.js --env production &
```

#### 3. Backup Verification Fails
```bash
# Check backup file integrity
ls -la backups/dhash_*.zip
file backups/dhash_*.zip

# Verify checksum manually
sha256sum backups/dhash_production_latest.zip
cat backups/dhash_production_latest.zip.sha256

# Test backup extraction
unzip -t backups/dhash_production_latest.zip
```

#### 4. Quality Gates False Positives
```bash
# Check current metrics
curl -s https://dhash.production.example.com/metrics | jq

# Adjust thresholds if needed (emergency only)
cp quality-gates-config.json quality-gates-config.json.backup
# Edit thresholds in quality-gates-config.json

# Restart monitoring with new config
pkill -f monitor_dhash
node scripts/monitor_dhash.js --env production &
```

### Log Locations

- **Deployment logs**: `deploy_logs/`
- **Monitoring logs**: `monitor_logs/`
- **Rollback logs**: `rollback_logs/`
- **Backup logs**: Inside backup ZIP files
- **Application logs**: `/var/log/dhash/` (or configured location)

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check service status
curl -v https://dhash.production.example.com/health

# Verify configuration
node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify(require('./quality-gates-config.json'), null, 2))"

# Test notification system
node scripts/notify.js --test --message "Test notification from production"

# Check backup history
ls -lat backups/ | head -10

# Verify database connectivity
# (Replace with actual database check command)
psql -h prod-db -U dhash -c "SELECT 1;"
```
