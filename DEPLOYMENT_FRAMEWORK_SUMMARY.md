# MOBIUS Deployment Framework - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

✅ **Complete deployment readiness framework implemented**
✅ **Modular deployment scripts with SHA256-verified backups**
✅ **Multi-OS pre-merge CI pipeline with artifact uploads**
✅ **Production runbooks and notification templates**
✅ **Conservative T+60 monitoring with auto-rollback**
✅ **Comprehensive operator quick-reference commands**

## 📁 Deliverables Overview

### 1. Modular Deployment Scripts (`scripts/deploy/`)

| Script | Purpose | Key Features |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `backup_dhash.sh` | SHA256-verified backups | Includes checksums, metadata, integrity verification |
| `deploy_dryrun.sh` | Deployment simulation | Multi-phase validation without changes |
| `migration_dryrun.sh` | Migration analysis | Database/config change assessment |
| `smoke_tests.sh` | Post-deployment testing | Comprehensive health and functionality checks |
| `monitor.sh` | Health monitoring | 60-min window, auto-rollback triggers |
| `rollback_dhash.sh` | Emergency rollback | Verified backup restoration |
| `lcm_export.sh` | Lifecycle management | Configuration and artifact exports |
| `premerge_orchestration.sh` | Complete validation | Orchestrates all pre-merge checks |
| `quick_commands.sh` | Operator helper | Copy-paste ready command reference |

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/`)

**premerge-validation.yml** features:
- Multi-OS matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- Comprehensive validation workflow
- Artifact uploads for review
- Automated PR comments with results
- Deployment readiness assessment

### 3. Production Runbooks (`runbooks/`)

- **deployment_runbook.md**: Step-by-step deployment procedures
- **rollback_runbook.md**: Emergency rollback and incident response

### 4. Notification Templates (`notifications/`)

- **Slack templates**: Rich message cards for deployment events
- **Teams templates**: Actionable message cards
- **Email templates**: Stakeholder notifications
- **Template variables**: Dynamic content support

### 5. Documentation

- **Comprehensive README**: Framework usage and configuration
- **PR body template**: Copy-paste ready content
- **Quick command reference**: Operator-friendly commands

## 🔐 Safety Features Implemented

### Conservative Auto-rollback Thresholds
- ✅ 3 consecutive health check failures → trigger rollback
- ✅ Success rate < 70% after ≥5 checks → trigger rollback  
- ✅ p95 latency > 5000ms consistently → trigger rollback
- ✅ Error rate > 5% → trigger rollback

### SHA256-Verified Security
- ✅ All backups include SHA256 checksums
- ✅ Integrity verification before rollback
- ✅ Backup metadata with git information
- ✅ Emergency backup creation during rollback

### Multi-layer Validation
- ✅ Pre-merge CI validation across platforms
- ✅ Deployment dry-run simulation
- ✅ Migration impact analysis  
- ✅ Post-deployment smoke testing
- ✅ 60-minute monitoring window

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Complete Deployment Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create backup
./scripts/deploy/backup_dhash.sh --env production

# 2. Run deployment dry-run  
./scripts/deploy/deploy_dryrun.sh --env production

# 3. Execute deployment (your process)
# [Your deployment commands here]

# 4. Start monitoring with auto-rollback
MONITOR_DURATION=3600 AUTO_ROLLBACK=true ./scripts/deploy/monitor.sh --env production &

# 5. Verify deployment
./scripts/deploy/smoke_tests.sh --env production
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Find latest verified backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)
sha256sum -c "${LATEST_BACKUP}.sha256"

# Execute rollback
./scripts/deploy/rollback_dhash.sh --backup "$LATEST_BACKUP" --env production
```

### Pre-merge Validation
```bash
# Run complete validation suite
./scripts/deploy/premerge_orchestration.sh --env staging

# CI automatically runs on PR creation
# Artifacts uploaded for review
# PR comments added with validation results
```
