  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_dhash.sh --dry-run
  ```
- [ ] Health endpoints validated on staging:
  ```bash
  curl -f http://staging.example.com:5001/health

  ```
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled and stakeholders notified

### âœ… Migration Readiness
- [ ] Database migrations tested in staging environment
- [ ] Rollback procedures validated
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for post-deployment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for comparison
- [ ] Smoke test suite passes locally

### âœ… Post-Merge Actions
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run comprehensive smoke tests on staging
- [ ] Validate performance metrics within expected ranges:
  - avg_hash_time < 50ms
  - p95_hash_time < 200ms
  - extraction_failures_rate < 5%
- [ ] Monitor deployment for 30-60 minutes
- [ ] Update production deployment schedule
- [ ] Notify operations team of successful staging deployment

## Emergency Procedures

### ðŸš¨ If Issues Are Found
- [ ] Stop the merge process immediately
- [ ] Document the issue in detail
- [ ] Revert to last known good state if necessary
- [ ] Fix issues in feature branch
- [ ] Re-run full validation checklist

### ðŸš¨ Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered post-merge:
1. **Immediate Response**: Execute rollback script
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rollback_dhash.sh --force
   ```
2. **Verification**: Run smoke tests to confirm system stability
   ```bash
   npm run smoke-test:quiet
   ```
3. **Investigation**: Preserve logs and artifacts for root cause analysis
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of rollback and timeline for fix
