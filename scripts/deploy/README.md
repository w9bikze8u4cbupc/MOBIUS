# MOBIUS Deployment Framework

A complete deployment readiness framework providing modular deployment scripts, multi-OS pre-merge CI pipeline, production runbooks, and conservative T+60 monitoring with auto-rollback capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Pre-merge Validation

1. **Create a pull request** - The framework automatically triggers validation
2. **Review CI results** - Multi-OS validation runs across Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
3. **Get approvals** - Require ‚â•2 reviewers including ‚â•1 Ops/SRE
4. **Deploy operator sign-off** - Get @ops team approval
5. **Merge** - Use rebase-and-merge for clean history

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Create backup
./scripts/deploy/backup_dhash.sh --env production

# Run deployment dry-run
./scripts/deploy/deploy_dryrun.sh --env production

# Execute deployment (replace with your actual deployment process)
# Your deployment commands here...

# Start post-deployment monitoring
MONITOR_DURATION=3600 AUTO_ROLLBACK=true ./scripts/deploy/monitor.sh --env production &

# Run smoke tests
./scripts/deploy/smoke_tests.sh --env production
```

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Find latest backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)

# Verify and execute rollback
sha256sum -c "${LATEST_BACKUP}.sha256"
./scripts/deploy/rollback_dhash.sh --backup "$LATEST_BACKUP" --env production
```

## üîê Safety Features

### Conservative Auto-rollback Thresholds

- **3 consecutive health check failures** ‚Üí trigger rollback
- **Success rate < 70%** after ‚â•5 checks ‚Üí trigger rollback  
- **p95 latency > 5000ms** consistently ‚Üí trigger rollback
- **Error rate > 5%** ‚Üí trigger rollback

### SHA256-verified Backups

All backups include SHA256 checksums for integrity verification:

```bash
# Backup verification
sha256sum -c backup_file.zip.sha256
```

### Multi-layer Validation

1. **Pre-merge CI**: Multi-OS validation, dependency scanning, vulnerability checks
2. **Dry-run validation**: Deployment simulation without changes
3. **Migration analysis**: Database and configuration change assessment  
4. **Post-deployment monitoring**: 60-minute health monitoring window

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Scripts

### backup_dhash.sh

Creates SHA256-verified backups of critical application components.

```bash
./scripts/deploy/backup_dhash.sh --env production --backup-dir /custom/path
```

**Features:**
- Includes application code, dependencies, configuration, tests
- Generates SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
- Creates backup metadata with git info and environment details
- Supports custom backup directories

### deploy_dryrun.sh

Simulates deployment process without making actual changes.

```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy_dryrun.sh --env production --log-file deploy-dryrun.log
```

**Validation phases:**
1. Pre-deployment checks (Node.js, npm, package integrity)
2. Dependency analysis (security vulnerabilities, peer dependencies)
3. Build validation (TypeScript compilation, npm scripts)
4. Configuration validation (environment-specific settings)
5. Service health simulation
6. Risk assessment

### migration_dryrun.sh

Analyzes database and configuration migrations without execution.

```bash
./scripts/deploy/migration_dryrun.sh --env production --log-file migration-dryrun.log
```

**Analysis includes:**
- Migration script discovery and validation
- Dependency change analysis  
- Configuration schema changes
- Database migration simulation
- Rollback procedure preparation
- Risk assessment

### smoke_tests.sh

Comprehensive post-deployment verification tests.

```bash
./scripts/deploy/smoke_tests.sh --env production --api-url https://api.example.com
```

**Test categories:**
- Basic system health (Node.js, npm, package integrity)
- API health checks (endpoints, response times)
- Core functionality (application-specific tests)
- Data processing (golden test validation)
- Performance and resource validation
- Environment-specific tests

### monitor.sh

Health monitoring with automatic rollback capabilities.

```bash
# 60-minute monitoring with auto-rollback
MONITOR_DURATION=3600 AUTO_ROLLBACK=true ./scripts/deploy/monitor.sh --env production &
```

**Monitoring features:**
- Configurable monitoring duration (default: 60 minutes)
- Health check intervals (default: 30 seconds)
- Conservative auto-rollback thresholds

```

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Branch Protection

Recommended GitHub branch protection rules:

- Require pull request reviews before merging (‚â•2 reviewers)
- Require review from code owners (Ops/SRE team)
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB

### Vulnerability Scanning

Automated security scanning in CI:
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Blocks deployment on critical vulnerabilities
- Reports high-severity issues for review

### Audit Trail

Complete audit trail maintained:
- Deployment timestamps and operators
- Git commit and branch information  
- Backup file integrity verification
- Health monitoring results
- Rollback activities and reasons

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Deployment configuration
ENV=staging|production
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001
MONITOR_DURATION=3600  # 60 minutes
