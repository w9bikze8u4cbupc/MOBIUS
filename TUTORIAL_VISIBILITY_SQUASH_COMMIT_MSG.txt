Add centralized env helper for tutorial visibility and gated debug logging

Summary:
- client/src/utils/env.js: parse and normalize REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL and REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL
- client/src/components/TutorialOrchestrator.jsx: use env helper; debug logs only in development + debug flag
- Tests for env helper and component visibility
- CI workflow to run lint (no warnings), tests, and production build on PRs

Risk: low â€” debug gating in dev only. See docs for validation and rollback steps.
