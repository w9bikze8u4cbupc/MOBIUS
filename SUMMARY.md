# Project Summary

This document summarizes all the files created to enhance the quality, reproducibility, and cross-platform compatibility of the Mobius Games Tutorial Generator.

## Sushi Go! Package

Complete tutorial package for Sushi Go! in the `games/sushi-go/` directory:

1. `asset_manifest.csv` - Lists all game assets with types, paths, sources, and licenses
2. `gig.json` - Game Instruction Graph with setup, rounds, and scoring operations
3. `contradictions.csv` - Component relationship definitions
4. `narration.ssml` - SSML markup for text-to-speech narration with timing markers
5. `theme.json` - Theme configuration for visual styling
6. `verification_config.json` - Configuration for verification checks

## Quality Assurance Scripts

Scripts to ensure consistent output quality across platforms in the `scripts/` directory:

### Provenance Capture
- `capture_provenance.sh` - Bash script for Unix systems
- `capture_provenance.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows
- `capture_provenance.bat` - Batch script for Windows

### Audio Compliance
- `check_audio_compliance.py` - Python script for Unix systems
- `check_audio_compliance.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows

### Container Verification
- `check_container.sh` - Bash script for Unix systems
- `check_container.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows
- `check_container.bat` - Batch script for Windows

## CI Workflow

Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
- Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Provenance capture
- Audio compliance checking
- Container verification
- Artifact uploading

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory:

1. `definition-of-done.md` - Complete checklist for PR approval
2. `audio-anti-pumping.md` - Implementation details for audio ducking
3. `debug-overlays.md` - Cross-platform debug overlay implementation

## Main Documentation

1. `README.md` - Project overview and usage instructions
2. `SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Implementation Notes

All scripts and configurations have been designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind:
- Shell scripts for Unix systems (Linux/macOS)
- PowerShell and Batch scripts for Windows
- Python scripts for Unix systems (with potential Windows compatibility)
- Platform-specific execution paths in CI workflow

The Sushi Go! package provides a complete, ready-to-use tutorial that can be rendered with:
```bash
npm run render -- games/sushi-go
```

Quality gates in the CI pipeline ensure that all generated tutorials meet the required standards for:
- Audio levels (EBU R128 compliance)
- Video specifications (format, resolution, frame rate)
- Content coverage (all required operations included)
- Cross-platform consistency
