# CI Runs Triage for PR #165

## Summary

This document tracks the CI runs for PR #165 and provides analysis of any failures and required fixes.

## CI Workflow Analysis

Based on the repository files, the CI workflow includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Run on Node.js 18.x and 20.x on Ubuntu
2. **Build and QA**: 
   - Cross-platform builds (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
   - FFmpeg rendering tests
   - Audio compliance checks
   - Container compliance checks
   - Artifact uploads

## Anticipated CI Failures and Fixes Implemented

### 1. Image Pull Failure
- **Issue**: The CI workflow references `registry.example.com/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated the image tag in `k8s/preview-worker/deployment.yaml` to use a placeholder `YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:TAG`

### 2. Missing Deployment Files
- **Issue**: CI runs `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` which might fail if manifests are missing
- **Fix**: Ensured deployment.yaml and service.yaml files exist with proper structure

## Monitoring CI Runs

Since we don't have API access to check the CI status directly, we need to manually check the GitHub PR page for CI status.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI runs on the PR page
2. Address any additional failures that may arise
3. Once CI is passing, proceed with merge checklist and rollout plan
