## Deployment Status

✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

### Prerequisites Met
- All Kubernetes manifests finalized with default values
- Container image build process defined
- Testing procedures established
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- Rollback procedures documented
- Cross-platform compatibility ensured
- Safety checks implemented

### Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Build and Push Container Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0 -f Dockerfile .
   docker push YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0
   ```

2. **Update Manifests with Actual Image Tag**
   ```bash
   # Cross-platform safe method using Perl
   IMAGE="YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0"
   grep -rl "ghcr.io/your-org/mobius-preview-worker:latest" k8s/preview-worker/ \
     | xargs -I{} perl -pi -e "s|ghcr.io/your-org/mobius-preview-worker:latest|${IMAGE}|g" {}
   ```

3. **Run Pre-Commit Safety Checks**
   ```bash
   # Verify changes
   git status
   git diff -- k8s/preview-worker/
   
   # Run tests
   npm ci
   npm run test:preview-payloads
   npm test
   npm run lint --if-present
   
   # Check for secrets
   git diff --staged
   
   # Validate manifests
   kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f k8s/preview-worker/
   ```

4. **Commit and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git add k8s/preview-worker/deployment.yaml
   git commit -m "chore(k8s): update preview worker image to YOUR_REGISTRY/mobius-preview-worker:1.0.0"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

5. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace preview-worker --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   kubectl apply -n preview-worker -f k8s/preview-worker/
   ```

6. **Run Smoke Tests**
   - Health endpoint verification
   - Dry-run job submission
   - Metrics endpoint check
   - HPA and ServiceMonitor verification

## Staged Rollout Plan

1. **Staging** (replicas=1, concurrency=1) - 24-48 hours smoke tests
2. **Canary production** - Route small % of jobs
3. **Gradual scale up** - Increase concurrency and replicas
4. **Full rollout** - Complete deployment

## Branches Available

1. **Main branch**: Contains all finalized manifests and core implementation
2. **feat/preview-worker-ci branch**: Contains additional CI/CD workflow and deployment tooling

To merge the CI/CD enhancements:
```bash
# Create PR from feat/preview-worker-ci to main
gh pr create --title "Add CI/CD and deployment tooling for Preview Worker" \
  --body-file PR_BODY_PREVIEW_WORKER_CI.md --base main --head feat/preview-worker-ci
```
