# Escalation Template: Missed Cadence

If a stream misses two consecutive cadence windows, send the following escalation note to program leadership and the relevant external owner.

> Team,
>
> We have now missed two consecutive cadence windows for the **{{stream_name}}** track (owner: {{owner_name}}). This jeopardizes the 720/1000 readiness posture. Immediate corrective action is required to regain schedule confidence.
>
> — {{your_name}}

## Required Actions

- Re-confirm availability with the external owner and request updated delivery ETA.
- Identify any internal blockers we can remove to accelerate artifact delivery.
- Update `ops/readiness-delta-register.md` with the new commitments and flag status as `At Risk`.
- Notify `#launch-ops` once a recovery plan is confirmed or further escalation is necessary.
