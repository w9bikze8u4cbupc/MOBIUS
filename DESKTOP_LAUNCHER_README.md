## Requirements
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## First-time Setup
On first run, the scripts will automatically:
1. Check for required dependencies
2. Install server dependencies (if not already installed)
3. Install client dependencies (if not already installed)
4. Start both the backend and frontend servers
5. Open your browser when the application is ready

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure all requirements are installed
2. Check that Node.js and npm are added to your system PATH
3. Run the scripts as Administrator if you encounter permission issues
4. Check the console output for specific error messages

## Manual Launch (Alternative)
If you prefer to launch manually, you can still use the traditional method:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend (port 5001) and frontend (port 3000) servers.
