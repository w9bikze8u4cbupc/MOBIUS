  cd client && npm test
  ```

- [ ] Smoke test dev servers:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # Verify frontend at http://localhost:3001
  # Verify backend health at http://localhost:5001/healthz
  ```

## 5. PR Creation

- [ ] Create branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b fix/ws-guard-test-teardown
  ```

- [ ] Stage all files:
  ```bash
  git add client/src/utils/__tests__/WebSocketGuard.test.js \
      client/src/utils/env.js \
      client/src/App.jsx \
      client/src/index.js \
      client/.eslintrc.json \

      CREATE_PR.bat \
      CREATE_PR.sh
  ```

- [ ] Commit changes:
  ```bash
  git commit -F COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt
  ```

- [ ] Push branch:
  ```bash
  git push --set-upstream origin fix/ws-guard-test-teardown
  ```

- [ ] Create PR using GitHub CLI (if available):
  ```bash
  gh pr create --title "Standardize REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST and add robust WebSocketGuard tests + teardown" --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md --base main
  ```

## 6. Post-PR Activities

- [ ] Monitor CI validation

- [ ] Merge after successful validation
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Communicate release to team

## 7. Team Announcement Template

```
Subject: PR Ready for Review - WebSocketGuard Improvements

Hi Team,

I've completed the WebSocketGuard improvements and standardized environment variable handling. The PR includes:

1. Standardized REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST access via helper utility
2. Robust WebSocketGuard tests with deterministic behavior
3. ESLint rule to prevent direct process.env access
4. Comprehensive documentation and automation scripts

Please review the PR and run the validation steps in MERGE_CHECKLIST.md.

Key files to review:
- client/src/utils/env.js
- client/src/utils/__tests__/WebSocketGuard.test.js
- client/.eslintrc.json

Thank you!
```

## 8. Release Management (If Applicable)

Following the structured release management workflow:
- [ ] Local verification of release artifacts
- [ ] Create dedicated release branch and PR with CI integration
- [ ] Run local smoke tests before merge
- [ ] Tag and publish only after CI success
- [ ] Post-release communications with clear messaging
- [ ] Active post-publish monitoring for at least 72 hours

This checklist ensures all aspects of the terminal-first project completion workflow are addressed, creating comprehensive documentation artifacts and providing ready-to-use scripts for final steps.
