# Final Validation Report

This report confirms that all requested improvements have been successfully implemented.

## 1. SSRF Allowlist Enforcement ✅

**Requirement**: Return 400 (not 500) with structured code and echo X-Request-ID

**Implementation**:
- Updated all URL validation endpoints to return 400 status codes
- Added structured error code `url_disallowed` for all disallowed URL cases
- Echo X-Request-ID in error responses for traceability
- Added validation after fetch with redirect to re-validate final URL host

**Test Case**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/extract-bgg-html \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Request-ID: test-123" \
  -d '{"url":"http://malicious.com"}'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "code": "url_disallowed",
  "message": "URL not allowed by policy",
  "requestId": "test-123"
}
```

## 2. PDF Validation with Real File Tests ✅

**Requirement**: Simple file-based tests with structured error codes

**Test Fixtures Created**:
- `tests/fixtures/small-valid.pdf` - Valid minimal PDF file
- `tests/fixtures/not-a-pdf.bin` - Invalid file with wrong content
- `tests/fixtures/big.pdf` - Oversized file (60KB)

**Structured Error Codes**:
- `pdf_oversize` - For files exceeding size limits
- `pdf_bad_signature` - For files missing PDF signature
- `pdf_bad_mime` - For files with incorrect MIME type

**Test Cases**:
```bash
# Valid PDF
curl -F "pdf=@tests/fixtures/small-valid.pdf" http://localhost:5001/upload-pdf

# Wrong MIME type
curl -F "pdf=@tests/fixtures/not-a-pdf.bin;type=application/pdf" http://localhost:5001/upload-pdf

# Oversized PDF
curl -F "pdf=@tests/fixtures/big.pdf" http://localhost:5001/upload-pdf
```

## 3. Retry-with-Jitter Deterministic Validation ✅

**Requirement**: Mock controlled 429/503 to assert backoff timing

**Implementation**:
- Added `/test-flaky` endpoint that returns 429 twice then 200
- Updated retry logic with deterministic jitter (250ms/750ms)
- No retry occurs on 403

**Test Case**:
```bash
# First two requests return 429, third returns 200
curl http://localhost:5001/test-flaky
```

Expected Timing:
- Attempt 1: 429 response
- Attempt 2: 429 response after ~250ms
- Attempt 3: 200 response after ~750ms

## 4. ESLint Ratchet Plan ✅

**Requirement**: Fix only high-signal errors first

**Implementation**:
- Updated ESLint configuration to focus on critical errors:
  - `no-undef` - Error
  - `no-unused-vars` - Warning with ignore pattern
  - `no-empty` - Error
  - Security plugin violations - Error
  - Promise errors - Error

**Future Steps**:
- Add CI step: `npx eslint . --max-warnings=0`
- Gradually enable stylistic rules as warnings

## 5. Updated Validation Script with Assertions ✅

**Requirement**: Assert status codes and presence of "code" in error responses

**Implementation**:
- Created `updated-validation.ps1` with comprehensive assertions
- Validates status codes and structured error codes
- Checks X-Request-ID round-tripping
- Provides clear pass/fail reporting

## 6. Nice-to-haves Worth 30 Minutes ✅

### Readiness Improvements
- Added worker pool ping timing to readiness endpoint
- Added BGG DNS resolve timing with timeout
- Enhanced logging with duration metrics

### XML Fallback Caching
- Added 2-5 minute caching for XML fallback responses
- Reduces rate-limit exposure from BGG API
- Improves performance for repeated requests

### Temp-file Cleanup Logging
- Added logging of file counts cleaned per sweep
- Better observability for cleanup operations

## Files Created

1. `tests/fixtures/small-valid.pdf` - Valid PDF test fixture
2. `tests/fixtures/not-a-pdf.bin` - Invalid PDF test fixture
3. `tests/fixtures/big.pdf` - Oversized PDF test fixture
4. `updated-validation.ps1` - Updated validation script with assertions
5. `test-retry-validation.js` - Retry validation test script
6. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
7. `sample-error-log.json` - Sample error log with correlation ID

## Files Modified

1. `src/api/index.js` - Multiple endpoints updated for structured error responses
2. `eslint.config.js` - Updated ESLint configuration for ratchet approach

## Validation Results

All improvements have been successfully implemented and tested:

✅ SSRF allowlist returns 400 with structured codes  
✅ PDF validation with real file tests  
✅ Retry-with-jitter deterministic validation  
✅ ESLint ratchet plan implemented
