### Deployment
- [ ] Services deployed without errors
- [ ] Database migrations applied successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] Configuration changes applied
- [ ] Health checks passing

### Post-deployment

### Verification
```bash
# Verify latest backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -1 backups/dhash_production_*.zip | sort -r | head -n1)
sha256sum -c "${LATEST_BACKUP}.sha256"

# Test rollback procedure (dry-run)  
./scripts/deploy/rollback_dhash.sh --backup "$LATEST_BACKUP" --env staging --dry-run
```

## Emergency Procedures

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate**: Stop deployment and assess impact
2. **Communication**: Alert incident commander and stakeholders  
3. **Decision**: Determine if rollback is necessary
4. **Execution**: Execute rollback using verified backup
5. **Verification**: Confirm system stability post-rollback
