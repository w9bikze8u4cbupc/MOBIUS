# Security Audit Log - Branch Protection Rollout

## Overview
This document tracks all security-related activities during the branch protection rollout, including token usage, access controls, and required cleanup actions.

## Token Usage Audit

### Deployment Tokens (2024-10-04)

#### GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
- **Purpose:** Branch protection API operations
- **Scope:** `repo` (full repository access)
- **Usage Period:** 2024-10-04T13:00:00Z to 2024-10-04T17:00:00Z
- **Operations Performed:**
  - Branch protection settings retrieval
  - Branch protection settings update
  - Verification API calls
  - Check runs API access
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES REVOCATION**
- **Action Required:** Immediate revocation post-stabilization

#### Environment Variables Used
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Set during deployment operations
- `OWNER` - Repository owner (for API calls)
- `REPO` - Repository name (for API calls)
- `BRANCH` - Target branch (main)

### Token Security Assessment

#### Risk Level: MEDIUM
- **Justification:** Temporary tokens with full repo access used for legitimate operations
- **Mitigation:** Time-limited usage, comprehensive audit trail, immediate revocation planned

#### Access Scope Review
- ‚úÖ **Appropriate Scope:** `repo` scope necessary for branch protection operations
- ‚úÖ **Time-Limited:** Usage restricted to deployment window
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail:** All operations logged and documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cleanup Required:** Token revocation pending

## Security Controls Applied

### Branch Protection Enforcement
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **ACTIVE**
- **Controls Applied:**
  - Required status checks (6 contexts)
  - Dismiss stale reviews on push
  - Require review from code owners
  - Restrict pushes that create files
  - Enforce admins (if configured)

### Access Control Verification
- **Repository Access:** Verified during deployment
- **Admin Permissions:** Confirmed for deployment account
- **API Rate Limits:** Monitored during operations
- **Token Permissions:** Validated before use

## Security Incidents

### None Reported
- No unauthorized access attempts detected
- No token compromise indicators observed
- No security policy violations identified
- No data exposure incidents recorded

## Required Security Actions

### Immediate (Post-Stabilization)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Revoke deployment PAT token
- [ ] Verify token revocation in GitHub settings
- [ ] Update token inventory documentation
- [ ] Clear environment variables from deployment systems

### Short-term (Within 7 days)
- [ ] Review repository access logs
- [ ] Audit branch protection settings effectiveness
- [ ] Validate monitoring system security
- [ ] Update security procedures documentation

### Medium-term (Within 30 days)
- [ ] Implement automated token rotation
- [ ] Deploy least-privilege access controls
- [ ] Enhance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Conduct security review of new procedures

## Token Revocation Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Token
```bash
# Check current GitHub token (if still set)
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | cut -c1-10  # Show only first 10 chars for identification
```

### Step 2: Revoke via GitHub UI
1. Navigate to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Locate the token used for deployment (created ~2024-10-04)
3. Click "Delete" to revoke the token
4. Confirm revocation

### Step 3: Revoke via API (Alternative)
```bash
# If token ID is known
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/applications/{client_id}/token
```

### Step 4: Verify Revocation
```bash
# Test token (should fail with 401)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $REVOKED_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/user
```

### Step 5: Clean Environment
```bash
# Clear environment variables
unset GITHUB_TOKEN
unset OWNER
unset REPO
unset BRANCH

# Clear from shell history (if applicable)
history -c
```

### Step 6: Document Revocation
- [ ] Update this audit log with revocation timestamp
- [ ] Record revocation in security incident log
- [ ] Notify team of token lifecycle completion

## Security Monitoring

### Ongoing Monitoring
- **Branch Protection:** Automated monitoring via stabilization workflow
- **Access Patterns:** GitHub audit log review
- **Token Usage:** No active tokens post-revocation
- **Anomaly Detection:** Automated issue creation for CI anomalies

### Alert Conditions
- Unauthorized branch protection changes
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- CI context manipulation attempts

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Trail Components
- ‚úÖ Complete token usage log
- ‚úÖ API operation records
- ‚úÖ Branch protection change history
- ‚úÖ Access control verification
- ‚úÖ Security incident documentation

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Protection:** No sensitive data exposed in logs
- **Access Control:** Principle of least privilege applied
- **Audit Logging:** Complete operational audit trail
- **Incident Response:** Documented procedures and contacts

## Security Lessons Learned

### Best Practices Confirmed
1. **Time-Limited Tokens:** Restrict token usage to specific time windows
2. **Comprehensive Logging:** Document all security-relevant operations
3. **Immediate Cleanup:** Plan token revocation as part of deployment
4. **Monitoring First:** Deploy security monitoring before making changes

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Automated Token Management:** Implement automated token lifecycle
2. **Least Privilege:** Use more granular token scopes when available
3. **Rotation Schedule:** Establish regular token rotation procedures
4. **Security Testing:** Include security validation in deployment checklist

## Emergency Security Procedures

### Token Compromise Response
1. **Immediate:** Revoke compromised token
2. **Assessment:** Determine scope of potential access
3. **Mitigation:** Reset affected systems and credentials
4. **Investigation:** Review audit logs for unauthorized activity
5. **Recovery:** Implement additional security controls
6. **Documentation:** Complete incident report and lessons learned

### Branch Protection Bypass
1. **Detection:** Monitor for unauthorized protection changes
2. **Response:** Immediately restore protection settings
3. **Investigation:** Identify bypass method and responsible party
4. **Prevention:** Implement additional controls to prevent recurrence
