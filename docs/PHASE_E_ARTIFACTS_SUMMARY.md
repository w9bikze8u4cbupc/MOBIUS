## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Canonical Data Directory Layout
- Standardized on `./data` as single canonical data directory
- All storage paths consolidated under DATA_DIR
- Migration script for legacy locations

### 2. Structured Logging
- JSON-formatted logs with timestamps and log levels
- Per-request correlation with unique request IDs
- Automatic request timing and completion logging

### 3. Metrics System
- Lightweight counter-based metrics collection
- Built-in counters for requests, errors, ingest operations
- Easy-to-extend metrics framework

### 4. Health & Monitoring Endpoints
- `/health` endpoint returning system status and metadata
- `/metrics` endpoint exposing all collected counters
- Proper JSON responses for monitoring tools

### 5. File Handling
- Multer uploads targeting canonical data directory
- Safe filename generation with timestamps
- Static file serving from uploads directory

## Run Commands

### Start Server
```bash
DATA_DIR=./data PORT=5001 npm run server
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

### View Metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/metrics
```

### Test File Upload
```bash
curl -F "file=@/path/to/rulebook.pdf" http://localhost:5001/api/ingest
```

### Migrate Legacy Data
```bash
DATA_DIR=./data npm run migrate:data
```

## Verification Procedures

### Automated Verification
1. Execute `scripts/verify-phase-e.sh` (Unix-like) or `scripts/verify-phase-e.ps1` (Windows)
2. Script will automatically:
   - Check prerequisites
   - Run migration
   - Start server
   - Test health endpoint
   - Test metrics endpoint
   - Test file upload
   - Verify file storage location
   - Clean up and stop server

### Manual Verification
1. Start server with `DATA_DIR=./data PORT=5001 npm run server`
2. Access `http://localhost:5001/health` - should return status "ok"
3. Access `http://localhost:5001/metrics` - should return counters
4. Upload a test file using curl
5. Verify file is stored in `./data/uploads/`
6. Check logs for JSON format with request IDs

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Health endpoint returns 200 with status "ok" | ✅ | Returns system metadata |
| Metrics endpoint returns counters | ✅ | Shows request counts |
| File uploads land in DATA_DIR/uploads | ✅ | Verified by migration script |
| Logs are JSON with request ID and timing | ✅ | Structured logging implemented |
| DATA_DIR env var changes all storage paths | ✅ | Path resolution uses DATA_DIR |

## Breaking Changes Handled

| Change | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Legacy file locations | Migration script consolidates to DATA_DIR |
| Backward compatibility | Maintained through migration process |

## Next Steps

1. Wire existing PDF parser + BGG + storyboard modules into `/api/ingest`
2. Add JUnit-style test output for ingest smoke test using redacted fixtures
3. Add request sampling around LLM calls once hooked in
4. Keep uploaded PDFs private under DATA_DIR; only redacted samples in CI

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

This implementation follows the user's cross-platform requirements:
- ✅ Paired verification scripts (.sh and .ps1)
- ✅ Cross-platform script pairing for critical automation
- ✅ Standardized verification output with clear status indicators

## Copyright Compliance

- Uploaded rulebook PDFs kept private in `./data/fixtures`
- Not committed to repository per copyright requirements
- Only redacted samples used in CI/CD pipelines
