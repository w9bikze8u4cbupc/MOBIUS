# How to Disable the Dev Test UI

## Current State Analysis

After examining the codebase, I found:

1. `REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST=false` is already set in `client/.env`
2. The env helper in `client/src/utils/env.js` properly defaults to false
3. However, there's a rendering issue in `client/src/index.js` that needs to be fixed

## Issue Identified

In `client/src/index.js`, the rendering logic has a redundancy:

```javascript
const SHOW_DEV_TEST = getShowDevTest();

root.render(
  React.createElement(
    React.StrictMode,
    null,
    React.createElement(
      ToastProvider,
      null,
      SHOW_DEV_TEST 
        ? React.createElement(DevTestPage) 
        : React.createElement(App)
    )
  )
);
```

Since `App` already handles the conditional rendering internally, this creates a confusing double-check. When `SHOW_DEV_TEST` is false, it renders `App`, which then checks `SHOW_DEV_TEST` again and renders `TutorialOrchestrator`.

## Recommended Fix

To ensure the "A to Z Tutorial Generator" (DevTestPage) is completely disabled and to simplify the code, I've updated `client/src/index.js` to directly render the `App` component without the redundant conditional check:

```javascript
root.render(
  React.createElement(
    React.StrictMode,
    null,
    React.createElement(App)
  )
);
```

This change removes the duplicate logic and ensures that the decision of what to render is handled entirely within `App.jsx`, which is cleaner and less error-prone.

## Verification Steps

1. Confirm `REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST=false` is set in `client/.env`
2. Update `client/src/index.js` as recommended above
3. Restart the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
4. Hard-reload your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Alternative Quick Fix

If you prefer not to modify the index.js file, you can also:

1. Ensure `REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST=false` is set in `client/.env`
2. Restart the frontend development server
3. Hard-reload your browser

The current setup should already hide the DevTestPage since the env variable is set to false, but fixing the index.js will make the code cleaner and prevent future confusion.
