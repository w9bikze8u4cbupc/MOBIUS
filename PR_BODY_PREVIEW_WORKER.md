# Preview Worker Implementation - Production Ready

## Summary
This PR implements a production-ready Preview Worker system with comprehensive validation, queuing, metrics, and monitoring capabilities. The worker processes preview generation jobs asynchronously using BullMQ and Redis, with robust error handling, retry logic, and validation.

## Why
The Preview Worker system was needed to:
1. Offload preview generation from the main API thread to improve responsiveness
2. Provide reliable job queuing with persistence and retry mechanisms
3. Enable horizontal scaling of preview generation workloads
4. Add comprehensive validation to prevent malformed job processing
5. Implement proper metrics collection for observability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Worker processes jobs asynchronously using BullMQ and Redis
- [x] Payload validation prevents malformed jobs from being processed
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient failures
- [x] Dead letter queue configuration isolates persistent failures
- [x] Idempotency support prevents duplicate job processing
- [x] Priority handling allows high-priority jobs to be processed first
- [x] Metrics collection tracks job outcomes and durations
- [x] Health check endpoint monitors worker system status
- [x] API integration allows job submission and status checking
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests validate functionality
- [x] CI/CD workflow runs tests on PRs
- [x] Documentation explains usage and integration

## Manual QA
1. Start Redis server locally
2. Run the worker: `npm run worker:preview`
3. Submit a job via the API: `POST /api/preview/job`
4. Check job status: `GET /api/preview/job/{jobId}/status`
5. Verify metrics collection via Prometheus endpoint
6. Test health check: `GET /api/preview/worker/health`

## Post-Merge Rollout
1. Deploy worker service to staging environment
2. Configure Redis connection in environment variables
3. Set up monitoring and alerting for worker metrics
4. Verify job processing in staging
5. Deploy to production with appropriate scaling

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Redis connectivity issues
  - **Mitigation**: Health check endpoint monitors Redis status
- **Risk**: Job processing failures
  - **Mitigation**: Retry logic with exponential backoff and dead letter queue
- **Risk**: High memory usage with large payloads
  - **Mitigation**: Payload validation and size limits
- **Risk**: Duplicate job processing
  - **Mitigation**: Idempotency with job IDs

## Next Steps
1. Implement horizontal scaling for worker processes
2. Add more detailed metrics for queue depth and processing times
3. Implement job cancellation functionality
4. Add support for job progress tracking
5. Enhance error reporting with detailed failure reasons
