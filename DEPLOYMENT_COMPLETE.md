**Usage**:
```bash
npm run dhash:backup:create      # Create new backup
npm run dhash:backup:verify      # Verify latest backup

## 📊 System Metrics

The system tracks and reports the following key metrics:

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - `avg_hash_time_ms`: Average DHash generation time
  - `p95_hash_time_ms`: 95th percentile hash time
  - `processing_rate_per_hour`: Images processed per hour

- **Quality Metrics**:
  - `extraction_failures_rate`: Percentage of failed extractions
  - `low_confidence_queue_length`: Items requiring manual review
  - `duplicate_rate`: Percentage of duplicate images detected

- **System State**:
  - `last_migration_timestamp`: Last migration execution
  - `last_backup_timestamp`: Last backup creation
  - `system_health_status`: Overall system health

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js 18+ installed
2. ImageMagick installed (optional, system includes fallback)
3. Sufficient disk space for backups
4. Network access for health monitoring

### Deployment Process
1. **Pre-deployment**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Create and verify final backup
   npm run dhash:backup:create
   npm run dhash:backup:verify
   
   # 2. Run migration dry-run
   npm run dhash:migrate:dry-run
   ```

2. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Execute atomic deployment
   npm run dhash:deploy
   ```

3. **Post-deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Run smoke tests
   npm run dhash:smoke-tests
   
   # Check system health
   npm run dhash:health
   npm run dhash:metrics
   ```

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor `/health` endpoint (should return 200 OK)
   - Monitor `/metrics/dhash` for key metrics
   - Watch for low-confidence queue buildup
   - Verify backup retention is working

## 📋 Next Steps (Optional Features)

The core system is complete and production-ready. Optional enhancements could include:

1. **OCR Integration**: Add optical character recognition for text in images
2. **Semantic Embeddings**: Implement CLIP-based semantic similarity
3. **Manual Review UI**: Web interface for reviewing low-confidence items
4. **Canary Rollouts**: Gradual deployment for large libraries
5. **Advanced Monitoring**: Grafana/Prometheus integration

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ImageMagick not found**: System automatically falls back to simple hash method
2. **Low confidence items**: Use `npm run dhash:migrate:export-low-conf` to review
3. **Deployment failure**: System automatically rolls back, check logs in `/logs`
4. **Health check fails**: Verify library directory exists and is readable

### Support

- Check logs in `/logs` directory
- Run `npm run dhash:smoke-tests` to validate system
- Monitor `/health` and `/metrics/dhash` endpoints
- Review backup integrity with `npm run dhash:backup:verify`
