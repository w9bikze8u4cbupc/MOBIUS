### 11. Edge-Case Tests
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Framework for edge-case testing
- Very small/large PDF handling
- Multilingual component extraction
- TTS chunking for large paragraphs
- Timeline without audio track handling

### 12. ESM Safety
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: ESM compatibility fixes
- Dynamic imports for Node core modules
- Lazy-loading of pdfjs legacy inside handlers
- Verified no top-level import crashes
