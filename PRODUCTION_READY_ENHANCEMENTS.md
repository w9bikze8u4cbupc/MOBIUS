# Production-Ready Enhancements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the enhancements made to make the component extraction system production-ready across more games.

## 1. Consistency Checks

### Implementation
Added validation logic to check that breakdown sums match the top-level quantity when applicable:
- Allies/Monsters sum must equal Exploration cards count
- Multiplier breakdowns (count × value) must sum counts to top-level tokens

### Features
- Warnings logged in verbose mode when mismatches are detected
- Components marked with low confidence when inconsistencies found
- Clear error messages showing expected vs. actual values

### Example Output
```
⚠️  BREAKDOWN MISMATCH: Exploration cards total 70 != sum of subtypes 71 (Allies: 65, Monsters: 6)
⚠️  BREAKDOWN MISMATCH: Monster tokens total 19 != sum of multipliers 20
```

## 2. Synonym Coverage

### Implementation
Extended synonym support while maintaining strict canonical labels:
- Ordered synonym list for easy maintenance
- "Pearl token(s)" → "Pearls"
- "Main board" / "Gameboard" → "Game board"
- "Location(s)" → "Location tiles"
- "Threat token" remains excluded unless explicitly added to a game's allowlist

### Benefits
- Better matching without loosening the allowlist
- Easy to extend with new synonyms
- Maintains backward compatibility

## 3. OCR Resilience

### Implementation
Extended OCR normalization with additional common glitches:
- "expi0ration" → "exploration"
- "t0kens" → "tokens"
- De-duplication of repeated words: "Plastic Plastic Cups" → "Plastic Cups"
- Normalization of stray colons/dashes around counts

### Features
- Comprehensive OCR correction before pattern matching
- Handles common scanning artifacts
- Improves extraction accuracy with poor quality scans

## 4. Section Scoping Fallback Rules

### Implementation
Enhanced fallback logic with confidence requirements:
- At least 2 distinct allowed labels present, OR
- Lines formatted as "Label — Quantity" for ≥2 lines
- Otherwise, returns empty with verbose note "low-confidence fallback suppressed"

### Benefits
- Prevents false positives when section headers are missing
- Maintains accuracy even with fallback to full text
- Clear logging when fallback is suppressed

## 5. Reason Codes for Logging

### Implementation
Standardized machine-parsable reason codes:
- Kept: `matched_quantity`, `bare_item_colon`, `number_word`, `item_with_parentheses`, `simple_item`
- Dropped: `caption_reward`, `image_reference`, `example`, `reward_text`, `instruction`, `setup_instruction`, `not_in_allowlist`, `no_pattern_match`, `breakdown_only`

### Benefits
- Faster triage of future regressions
- Machine-readable logs for automated analysis
- Consistent categorization of extraction decisions

## 6. Golden Pack + CI Gating

### Implementation
- Promoted Abyss to a "golden pack" with comprehensive test coverage
- Created YAML configuration for multi-game golden tests
- Added scripts for running all tests together

### Features
- YAML-based test configuration for easy extension
- Template for future games
- CI-required checks to prevent regressions

### Example YAML Structure
```yaml
abyss:
  expected:
    - { label: "Game board", quantity: 1 }
    - { label: "Exploration cards", quantity: 71, breakdown:
        [ {label: "Allies", quantity: 65}, {label: "Monsters", quantity: 6} ] }
    # ... more components
```

## 7. Enhanced Negative Tests

### Implementation
Added comprehensive negative test coverage:
- "Player board(s)" lines correctly ignored for Abyss
- Setup instruction lines with valid nouns but imperative verbs dropped
- Extended test suite with more edge cases

### Benefits
- Prevents false positives
- Ensures robust exclusion patterns
- Validates edge case handling

## 8. E2E Quick Check Integration

### Implementation
- JSON output validation for downstream consumers
- Verification of required fields: supply quantities, exact labels, breakdown structure
- Ready for integration into full pipeline testing

### Features
- Validates extractor output format
- Ensures compatibility with downstream systems
- Provides clear error messages for integration issues

## New Test Scripts

All new test scripts have been added to package.json:

```bash
npm run test:consistency     # Test breakdown sum assertions
npm run test:synonyms        # Test synonym coverage
npm run test:ocr             # Test OCR enhancements
npm run test:fallback        # Test section scoping fallback rules
npm run test:reason-codes    # Test reason code standardization
npm run test:enhanced-negative  # Test additional negative cases
npm run test:all             # Run all tests together
```

## Files Created/Modified

1. `src/api/utils.js` - Main extraction logic with all enhancements
2. `golden-tests.yaml` - Golden pack configuration
3. Test files:
   - `test-consistency.js` - Breakdown sum assertions
   - `test-synonyms.js` - Synonym coverage tests
   - `test-ocr.js` - OCR enhancement tests
   - `test-fallback.js` - Section scoping fallback tests
   - `test-reason-codes.js` - Reason code standardization tests
   - `test-enhanced-negative.js` - Additional negative tests
4. `package.json` - Added new test scripts
5. `PRODUCTION_READY_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - This documentation

## Benefits

1. **Production-Ready**: System is now robust enough for production use across multiple games
2. **Maintainable**: Ordered synonym lists and reason codes make maintenance easier
3. **Debuggable**: Comprehensive logging and reason codes enable fast issue resolution
4. **Extensible**: YAML configuration and modular design support future games
5. **Reliable**: Consistency checks and enhanced negative tests prevent regressions
6. **Compatible**: E2E validation ensures downstream system compatibility

## Usage Examples

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```

### Verbose Extraction with All Features
```bash
npm run extract:text -- fixtures/abyss.contents.txt --verbose
```

### CI Integration
The system is ready for CI gating with the golden pack tests preventing merges when critical functionality breaks.
