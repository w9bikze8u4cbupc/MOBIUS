# Production-Ready Enhancements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the enhancements made to transform the Mobius Games Tutorial Generator from a basic prototype into a production-ready application with robust security, reliability, and operational features.

## Development Workflow Enhancements

### Process Management
- **PID Files**: Added process ID tracking for clean shutdowns
- **Force-Kill**: Implemented SIGKILL/-Force termination for stuck processes
- **Port Verification**: Added checks to ensure ports are actually free before startup
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation with timestamped backups

### Location Awareness
- **Scripts**: Updated all development scripts to work from any directory
- **Path Resolution**: Used `$PSScriptRoot` and `__dirname` for reliable path resolution

### Smoke Testing
- **Startup Verification**: Added smoke tests during dev startup
- **Health Checks**: Integrated `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints for validation
- **Quick Validation**: Scripts now verify critical paths work correctly

### Status Commands
- **Process Monitoring**: Added `dev-status` commands to check running processes
- **Log Inspection**: Easy access to current and rotated log files
- **Health Reporting**: Real-time status of backend and frontend services

## API Hygiene

### Rate Limiting
- **Token Bucket Implementation**: Created configurable rate limiter for BGG API calls
- **User-Agent Headers**: Added proper identification for BGG requests
- **Exponential Backoff**: Built-in retry logic with increasing delays
- **Friendly Headers**: Standard HTTP headers for client-side rate limit handling

### Caching
- **BGG Response Cache**: Memoization of BGG API responses to avoid repeat fetches
- **TTL Configuration**: Configurable cache expiration (default 6-12 hours)
- **URL Normalization**: Cache keys that handle bggUrl variations consistently

## PDF Pipeline Resilience

### Worker Threads
- **Off-Main-Thread Processing**: Heavy PDF/image work moved to worker threads
- **Concurrency Limits**: Bounded worker pool to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Job Recycling**: Workers automatically recycled after N jobs to avoid leaks
- **Memory Monitoring**: Heap usage tracking with automatic cleanup

### Error Handling
- **Clear Error Envelopes**: Structured error responses with actionable hints
- **Size Recommendations**: Guidance for PDF size issues
- **Rebuild Suggestions**: Help text for sharp/pdf-to-image rebuild scenarios

## Health Endpoints

### Liveness (`/livez`)
- **Basic Check**: Simple "OK" response to confirm service is running
- **Fast Response**: Minimal overhead health check for load balancers

### Readiness (`/readyz`)
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Multi-point health check including:
  - Outbound HTTP connectivity (BGG fetch to known small ID)
  - Temp directory writeability for thumbnails
  - Cache directory read/write access
  - Required API key presence
  - Event loop responsiveness
  - Memory usage within limits

## Observability

### Structured Logging
- **JSON Format**: Consistent structured logging with levels (info/warn/error)
- **Correlation IDs**: Per-request tracing with `X-Request-ID` support
- **Timing Metrics**: Request duration tracking in logs
- **Context Enrichment**: Automatic inclusion of method, path, timestamp

### Debug Instrumentation
- **Upstream Response Times**: BGG fetch timing metrics
- **PDF Conversion Timings**: Processing duration tracking
- **Memory Monitoring**: RSS and heap usage reporting

## CI/CD Improvements

### GitHub Actions Hardening
- **Node Matrix**: Testing across Node.js 18.x and 20.x versions
- **Dependency Caching**: npm cache for faster builds
- **Concurrency Safety**: Workflow concurrency groups with cancel-in-progress
- **Log Upload**: Automatic artifact upload on failure for debugging
- **Build Verification**: Frontend build checks in CI environment

### Integration Testing
- **Headless Health Checks**: Automated startup → health check → shutdown flow
- **JSON Shape Validation**: Assertion of expected response structures
- **Smoke Testing**: Quick validation of critical user paths

## Security Hardening

### SSRF Prevention
- **URL Allowlist**: Strict hostname validation for outbound requests
- **BGG-Only Access**: Prevented access to internal services or unauthorized endpoints
- **Private IP Blocking**: Rejection of requests to private network ranges

### PDF Safety
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size enforcement (50MB default)
- **MIME Validation**: Content type checking for PDF files
- **Signature Verification**: Magic header validation for PDF format
- **Content Parsing**: Actual PDF parsing to ensure document validity

### Temp File Management
- **Auto-Reap**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files after TTL expiration
- **Secure Storage**: Proper temporary directory usage with permissions
- **Resource Cleanup**: Prevention of disk space exhaustion

## Configuration Management

### Environment Examples
- **Backend**: [.env.example](file:///c:/Users/danie/Documents/mobius-games-tutorial-generator/.env.example) with all required variables
- **Frontend**: [client/.env.example](file:///c:/Users/danie/Documents/mobius-games-tutorial-generator/client/.env.example) with API configuration

### Timeout Configuration
- **Request Timeouts**: Configurable via `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`
- **Health Check Timeouts**: Separate timeout for health endpoints
- **BGG Fetch Timeouts**: Customizable BGG API call timeouts

## Documentation

### Operations & Security Guide
- **Security Model**: Comprehensive documentation of implemented protections
- **Health Endpoints**: Semantics and usage of /healthz and /readyz
- **Observability**: Logging format and correlation ID usage
- **Worker Pool**: Concurrency, recycling, and memory safety notes

### README Updates
- **API Hygiene**: Rate limiting and caching documentation
- **Health Checks**: Endpoint usage and semantics
- **Observability**: Logging and debugging guidance
- **Troubleshooting**: Quick reference for common issues

## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Tests
- **URL Validator**: Tests for BGG allowlist and validation logic
