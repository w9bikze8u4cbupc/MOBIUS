# Issue Report: UI Interaction Not Possible in Validation Environment

## Issue ID
20251020_002

## Checklist Item
Multiple UI-related items in Sections A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K

## Description
UI interaction is not possible in the current validation environment, preventing testing of UI-related functionality. This affects the ability to test project setup, BGG metadata display, visual asset management, script editing, audio playback, rendering controls, quality checks, packaging options, CI hooks configuration, and delivery settings.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Attempt to interact with the UI through automated means
2. Observe that UI elements cannot be programmatically accessed
3. Note that manual UI interaction is not part of the current validation process

## Expected Behavior
UI-related functionality should be testable through automated means or manual interaction.

## Actual Behavior
UI-related functionality cannot be tested in the current validation environment.

## Environment
- OS: Windows 11
- Mobius Version: 1.0.1
- Node.js Version: v20.12.2

## Evidence
- Batch 1 Summary: [BATCH1_SUMMARY.md](../batch1/BATCH1_SUMMARY.md)

## Root Cause Analysis
The current validation environment is focused on API-level testing and does not include UI automation tools or manual UI interaction capabilities. This is a limitation of the validation approach rather than a flaw in the application itself.

## Remediation Plan
1. Implement UI automation tools for testing UI functionality
2. Set up a manual testing environment for UI validation
3. Create end-to-end tests that include UI interaction
4. Update validation procedures to include UI testing

## Additional Context
This limitation affects the completeness of the validation process. While API-level functionality can be tested, the user experience and UI behavior cannot be validated without additional tooling or manual testing procedures.

## Mitigation Summary
An API validation harness has been created in [validation/tools/api-validation-harness.js](../../validation/tools/api-validation-harness.js) that provides programmatic access to UI-driven flows through direct API calls. This allows validation of functionality that would normally require UI interaction. The harness covers A- and B-section behaviors via API and can be extended to cover additional sections as needed. Documentation is available in [validation/tools/README.md](../../validation/tools/README.md).
