# Phase R3 Kickoff Brief

This brief outlines the agenda, decision checkpoints, and runbook actions for the Phase R3 readiness cycle. All operational execution remains with external partners; this document tracks internal coordination requirements.

## Decision Checkpoints
1. **Checkpoint 1 – Evidence Integrity Gate**
   - Requires completion of OPS1 Evidence Replacement Playbook items. Until verified, checkpoint remains blocked.
2. **Checkpoint 2 – Sanitization Restoration Review**
   - Confirm OPS2 has delivered sanitization updates and supporting evidence.
3. **Checkpoint 3 – Governance Alignment**
   - Validate governance cadence adjustments and sign-off from compliance.

## Runbook
1. Circulate agenda and pre-read materials 48 hours before the kickoff session.
2. Collect execution status from OPS1/OPS2 before the checkpoint meeting and update readiness trackers.
3. Review outstanding actions, assign owners, and capture follow-ups in the readiness delta register.
4. Publish recap notes with updated target dates and evidence links.

## Communication Cadence
- **Readiness Stand-up**: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 15 minutes.
- **Governance Sync**: Weekly on Wednesdays, include compliance and security liaisons.
- **Async Updates**: Maintain updates in the readiness delta register for quick visibility.
