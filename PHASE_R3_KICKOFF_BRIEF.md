# Phase R3 Kickoff Brief

The Phase R3 kickoff aligns OPS1, OPS2, Security, and partner teams on the remaining external deliverables required to unlock Preview Worker readiness checkpoints. This refreshed brief highlights the dependencies, coordination guardrails, and evidence expectations defined in the OPS1 Playbook and OPS2 Blueprint.

## Session Objectives
- Confirm ownership and delivery dates for all outstanding Readiness Delta Register entries.
- Reaffirm coordination guardrails for evidence replacement, sanitization restoration, and token releases.
- Establish the communication rhythm for readiness stand-ups and status polls.

## Attendees
- Preview Worker Phase F coordinator (facilitator)
- OPS1 duty lead and verifier
- OPS2 restoration lead
- Security liaison
- Data Engineering representative
- IAM policy owner
- Quality Engineering representative

## Agenda
1. **Readiness Delta Review**
   - Ledger status (720 / 1000) and gating criteria.
   - Walkthrough of OPS1 evidence replacement sequencing.
   - OPS2 sanitization restoration dependency check.
   - Security token release timeline and risks.
2. **Coordination Guardrails**
   - Change windows and freeze periods.
   - Required communication channels and escalation contacts.
3. **Artifact Delivery Commitments**
   - Confirm due dates and upload locations for every external artifact.
   - Assign owners for log ingestion into the repository documentation.
4. **Next Execution Orders**
   - Distribution of playbooks/blueprints.
   - Scheduling of readiness stand-up polls.
   - Preparation of evidence ingestion hooks.

## Pre-Read Materials
- `OPS1_EVIDENCE_REPLACEMENT_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `OPS2_SANITIZATION_RESTORATION_BLUEPRINT.md`
- `PHASE_F_PREVIEW_WORKER_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` (Outstanding Actions section)
- `PREVIEW_WORKER_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_SUMMARY.md` (Readiness Delta Register section)

## Decision Outcomes
- Updated Readiness Delta Register entries with confirmed owners and due dates.
- Logged acknowledgements from OPS1, OPS2, and Security for playbook receipt.
- Consensus on evidence ingestion timeline post-external completion.
- Action items documented in meeting minutes and linked in the register.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Circulate kickoff minutes within two hours of meeting close.
- Phase F coordinator to monitor delta register updates and notify leadership upon item closure.
- Prepare repository hooks for evidence ingestion (notarization transcripts, sanitization reports, token release proof).

This brief remains the single source of truth for Phase R3 coordination and must be updated if dependencies or guardrails change.
