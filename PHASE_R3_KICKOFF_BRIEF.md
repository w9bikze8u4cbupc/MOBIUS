# Phase R3 Kickoff Brief

## Objective
Transition from Phase R2 stabilization into Phase R3 execution with a focus on distribution workflow enhancements and advanced analytics instrumentation.

## Scope Overview
- **Distribution workflows:** Expand coverage to additional partners, automate packaging verification, and integrate delivery status telemetry.
- **Advanced analytics:** Implement render health dashboards, audio quality trend analysis, and audience engagement overlays.
- **Operational readiness:** Ensure live registry feed, QA automation, and evidence bundles remain aligned with new capabilities.

## Workstreams & Leads
| Workstream | Description | Lead | Target Kickoff |
|------------|-------------|------|----------------|
| Distribution Automation | Extend delivery pipelines, packaging validation, and failover routes. | Distribution PM | 2024-06-10 |
| Analytics Platform | Build dashboards for render pass trends, LUFS compliance tracking, and QC remediation insights. | Data Lead | 2024-06-11 |
| Operator Experience | Upgrade operator console with live telemetry, remediation links, and alert tuning. | Operations Lead | 2024-06-12 |
| Evidence & Compliance | Scale evidence bundle coverage for new workflows and jurisdictions. | Compliance Lead | 2024-06-12 |

## Key Deliverables
- Phase R3 execution plan aligned with stakeholder approvals.
- Updated analytics dashboards surfaced in operator UI and reporting suites.
- Automated distribution workflow validation with rollback coverage.
- Extended readiness ledger entries capturing R3 metrics and dependency status.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Prerequisite:** Phase R2 QA checklist passes without outstanding `ID:` notes.
- **Data alignment:** Live render registry must be stable before analytics instrumentation begins.
- **Resource allocation:** Ensure overlap with current QA/Ops bandwidth is managed to avoid bottlenecks.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize QA checklist and operator live wiring (Phase R2 closure).
2. Conduct R3 kickoff session with all workstream leads and confirm timelines.
3. Publish execution plan and align reporting cadence with readiness ledger updates.
4. Begin R3 backlog refinement and task assignment within two business days of kickoff.
