# Fix for A→Z Tutorial Generator Page Still Showing

## Issue Analysis

Despite setting `REACT_APP_SHOW_DEV_TEST=false` in the .env file, the DevTestPage (A→Z Tutorial Generator) was still being displayed. This indicates that either:

1. The environment variable is not being loaded correctly
2. There's a caching issue preventing the new environment variable from taking effect
3. There's an issue with how the environment variable is being processed

## Changes Made

1. **Temporary Fix in App.jsx**: I've temporarily hardcoded `SHOW_DEV_TEST = false` to force the application to always show the TutorialOrchestrator instead of the DevTestPage. This is commented in the code as a temporary fix.

2. **Added Debug Logging**: I've added console.log statements to help diagnose the issue with environment variable loading.

## Verification Steps

1. Restart the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

2. Check the browser console for the debug logs:
   - Look for "SHOW_DEV_TEST constant:" and "Rendering App component, SHOW_DEV_TEST:" messages
   - These will help determine if the environment variable is being loaded correctly

3. Hard-reload your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear any cached assets

## Next Steps for Permanent Fix

1. Check the browser console to see what values are being logged for the environment variable
2. If the environment variable is loading correctly, we can revert to using the [getShowDevTest()](file://c:\Users\danie\Documents\mobius-games-tutorial-generator\client\src\utils\env.js#L0-L4) function
3. If there are caching issues, we may need to:
   - Clear the build cache
   - Delete the node_modules folder and reinstall dependencies
   - Check for service workers that might be caching old code

## Alternative Solutions

If the environment variable approach continues to have issues, we can:

1. **Permanently use the hardcoded false value** (not recommended for production)
2. **Use localStorage** to control the UI mode
3. **Implement a more robust environment variable loading mechanism**

The current temporary fix ensures that users will see the main Tutorial Generator UI instead of the DevTestPage.
