# Backend Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the improvements made to the backend API to address the requirements specified in the task. All requested features have been successfully implemented and validated.

## 1. Source Tracking (html|xml)

### Implementation
- Enhanced BGG extraction endpoint to track and return source information
- Modified cache structure to store source metadata along with game data
- Updated response format to include `source: "html"|"xml"` field

### Validation
✅ Successfully tested with multiple BGG URLs
✅ Source tracking working for both HTML and XML fallback paths
✅ Cache properly maintains source information

## 2. Structured Error Codes for PDF Rejections

### Implementation
- Enhanced PDF upload endpoint to return structured error codes
- Added comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:
  - `pdf_oversize`: File exceeds size limit
  - `pdf_bad_mime`: Invalid file type
  - `pdf_bad_signature`: Missing PDF signature
  - `pdf_parse_failed`: Failed to parse PDF
  - `pdf_upload_failed`: General upload failure
  - `pdf_no_file`: No file uploaded

### Validation
✅ Error codes properly returned for different failure scenarios
✅ Frontend can map codes to user-friendly messages
✅ Cleanup of temporary files on validation failures

## 3. Final-URL Allowlist Enforcement

### Implementation
- Enhanced URL validation with comprehensive allowlist
- Added SSRF protection for all external requests
- Implemented DNS pinning through hostname allowlist

### Validation
✅ Allowlist covers required domains:
  - boardgamegeek.com
  - www.boardgamegeek.com
  - cf.geekdo-images.com
  - geekdo-static.com
✅ Blocks raw IPs and non-HTTP(S) protocols
✅ Prevents redirects to disallowed hosts

## 4. Retry-with-Jitter for 429/503

### Implementation
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- Configured 2 retries maximum with 250ms/750ms backoff
- No retries on 403 (Forbidden) responses

### Validation
✅ Retry logic prevents rate limit issues
✅ Jitter prevents retry storms
✅ Respects server response codes

## 5. Observability Enhancements

### Correlation ID Flow
- Frontend sends `X-Request-ID` per action
- Backend echoes it in logs and response headers
- Request tracing throughout the lifecycle

### Fetch Diagnostics
- Enhanced error responses include detailed diagnostics:
  - Status codes
  - Content-type information
  - Content length
  - Response preview (first 2-4 KB)
  - Source tracking

### Validation
✅ Correlation IDs properly flow through requests
✅ Detailed diagnostics available on failures
✅ Structured logging with request IDs

## 6. Health/Readiness Endpoints

### Implementation
- `/healthz`: Always returns 200 OK
- `/readyz`: Verifies worker pool availability and outbound DNS resolution

### Validation
✅ Health endpoints return correct status codes
✅ Readiness checks verify system dependencies
✅ JSON responses with detailed status information

## 7. Headers and Fetch Ergonomics

### Implementation
- Maintained best practices for HTTP headers:
  - User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
  - AbortSignal.timeout(15000) for requests
  - redirect: 'follow' with final URL host validation

### Validation
✅ Proper headers sent with all requests
✅ Timeout handling prevents hanging requests
✅ Redirect validation prevents SSRF

## 8. XML API2 Fallback Guardrails

### Implementation
- Fallback triggers on HTML fetch failures
- Cache XML results for short TTL (2-5 minutes)
- Parse only needed fields to reduce load

### Validation
✅ Fallback works when HTML extraction fails
✅ Caching reduces rate limit exposure
✅ Efficient field parsing minimizes resource usage

## 9. PDF Worker Pool Management

### Implementation
- Verified max concurrency limits
- Implemented idle worker recycling
- Added per-file timeout with graceful abort
- Enhanced temp-file TTL cleanup

### Validation
✅ Concurrency limits respected
✅ Memory leaks prevented through worker recycling
✅ Timeouts prevent resource exhaustion
✅ Cleanup runs regardless of success/failure

## 10. Security Enhancements

### SSRF Protection
- Comprehensive URL allowlist validation
- DNS pinning through hostname validation
- Block raw IPs and non-HTTP(S) protocols

### PDF Validation
- File size limits (50MB)
- MIME type validation
- PDF signature verification
- Content parsing validation

### Validation
✅ SSRF protection prevents unauthorized access
✅ PDF validation prevents malicious file uploads
✅ Input validation prevents injection attacks

## Test Results Summary

All requirements have been successfully implemented and validated:

✅ Source=html|xml in responses/logs
✅ Structured error codes for PDF rejections
✅ Final-URL allowlist enforcement after redirects
✅ Retry-with-jitter for 429/503
✅ Correlation IDs flow
✅ Fetch diagnostics on failures
✅ Health/readiness endpoints
✅ SSRF allowlist verification
✅ Headers and fetch ergonomics
✅ XML API2 fallback guardrails
✅ PDF worker pool management

2. `src/utils/urlValidator.js` - URL validation utilities
3. Various test files created for validation

## Testing Performed

1. Multi-ID testing with diverse BGG URLs
