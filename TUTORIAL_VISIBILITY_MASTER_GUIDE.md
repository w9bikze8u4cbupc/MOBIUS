# Tutorial Visibility Feature - Master Guide

## Project Overview

This document serves as the master guide for the Tutorial Visibility Feature implementation. The feature introduces environment-driven visibility control for the TutorialOrchestrator component, allowing teams to show/hide the tutorial UI without code changes.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components

1. **Environment Helper** (`client/src/utils/env.js`)
   - Centralized parsing of `REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL` and `REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL`
   - Safe boolean parsing with appropriate defaults
   - Development-only debug logging gated by `NODE_ENV`

2. **Component Integration** (`client/src/components/TutorialOrchestrator.jsx`)
   - Conditional rendering based on `getShowTutorial()`
   - Diagnostic logging gated to development when `getDebugTutorial()` is true
   - Maintains all existing functionality

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - `.env.example` with clear usage instructions
   - README updates with comprehensive usage guide
   - Inline code comments for clarity

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for environment helper functions
   - Component visibility behavior tests
   - Validation scripts for cross-platform compatibility

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Strict linting (warnings fail CI)
   - Build verification

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| `REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL` | Toggle tutorial UI visibility | `false` | Set to `true` to show tutorial |
| `REACT_APP_DEBUG_TUTORIAL` | Enable diagnostic logging | `false` | Only works in development |

## Git Status

All files have been committed to the `feat/tutorial-visibility` branch and pushed to the remote repository.

Branch: `feat/tutorial-visibility` (tracking `origin/feat/tutorial-visibility`)

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Pull Request
```bash
gh pr create --title "Add REACT_APP_SHOW_TUTORIAL env helper, docs, tests, and CI" \
  --body-file TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_PR_BODY.md --base main --head feat/tutorial-visibility --label "feature"
```

Alternative methods:
- Run `CREATE_TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_PR.bat` (Windows)
- Run `CREATE_TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_PR.sh` (macOS/Linux)
- Create PR manually through GitHub web interface

### 2. PR Process
1. Paste contents of `TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_REVIEWER_GUIDANCE.md` as a PR comment
2. Ensure all CI checks pass (lint, tests, build)
3. Request team review
4. Address any feedback

### 3. Post-Merge
1. Follow steps in `TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_POST_MERGE_COMMANDS.md`
2. Run smoke tests per `TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_SMOKE_TEST.md`
3. Monitor deployment per `TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_MONITORING.md`

### 4. In Case of Issues
Follow rollback procedures in `TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_ROLLBACK.md`

## Verification

Run the appropriate verification script for your platform:
- Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_FINAL_VERIFY.ps1`
- macOS/Linux: `bash TUTORIAL_VISIBILITY_FINAL_VERIFY.sh`

## Security Considerations

- Debug logging is gated to development environments only
- Environment variables use React-app specific prefixes
- No sensitive information is exposed through the feature

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: Low

The feature is a development utility that doesn't affect production code paths. The worst-case scenario would be the tutorial UI being visible when it should be hidden, which is a minor UX issue rather than a functional bug.
