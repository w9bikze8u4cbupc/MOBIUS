# Validation Results

## Summary Table

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Health checks (/healthz) | ✅ Pass | Returns 200 OK |
| Readiness checks (/readyz) | ✅ Pass | Returns 200 with worker pool and DNS check |
| BGG HTML extraction (3-5 IDs) | ✅ Pass | Returns success with source=html |
| Correlation IDs | ✅ Pass | X-Request-ID sent and echoed back |
| SSRF allowlist | ⚠️ Partial | Disallowed URLs return 500 instead of 400 |
| PDF validation | ⚠️ Partial | Requires actual PDF files for testing |
| Retry-with-jitter | ⚠️ Partial | Visible in logs but needs specific mocking |

## Detailed Results

### 1. Health and Readiness Checks
- ✅ `/healthz` returns 200 OK
- ✅ `/readyz` returns 200 with JSON status

### 2. BGG HTML Extraction
- ✅ Tested with 3 different game URLs
- ✅ All returned success: true
- ✅ All returned source: html
- ✅ All returned correct game titles

### 3. Correlation IDs
- ✅ X-Request-ID header sent in requests
- ✅ Same ID echoed back in response headers
- ✅ Visible in server logs

### 4. SSRF Allowlist
- ⚠️ Disallowed URLs (e.g., https://example.com) return 500 instead of 400
- ⚠️ Need to improve error handling for disallowed URLs

### 5. PDF Validation
- ⚠️ Could not test without actual PDF files
- ⚠️ Implementation exists but needs file-based testing

### 6. Retry-with-Jitter
- ⚠️ Retry logic visible in logs for failed requests
- ⚠️ Would benefit from specific 429/503 mocking for complete validation

## Recommendations
1. ✅ All major functionality working
2. ⚠️ Improve SSRF error handling to return 400 instead of 500
