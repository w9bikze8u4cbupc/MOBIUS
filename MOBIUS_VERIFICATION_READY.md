# MOBIUS Verification System - Ready for Use âœ…

## Status: COMPLETE

All verification scripts and utility tools have been implemented and are ready for use across development and CI environments.

## What's in the Repo

### Verification Scripts
- `mobius-verify.sh` - Enhanced bash script for Unix/macOS/WSL/Linux
- `mobius-verify.cmd` - Enhanced Windows batch script with PowerShell integration

### Utility Scripts (Cross-Platform Pairs)
- `scripts/kill-ports.sh` and `scripts/kill-ports.ps1` - Kill processes on specified ports
- `scripts/consolidate-mobius-folders.sh` and `scripts/consolidate-mobius-folders.ps1` - Consolidate scattered folders

### CI/CD Integration
- `.github/workflows/mobius-verify.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automated verification

### Package.json Updates
```json
"mobius:verify": "mobius-verify.cmd",
"mobius:verify:unix": "bash mobius-verify.sh"
```

## Port Configuration Confirmed
- **Frontend**: Port 3000 (configured in `client/.env`)
- **Backend**: Port 5001 (configured in `src/api/index.js`)

## How to Run Locally

### Unix / macOS / WSL / Linux
```bash
# Make sure scripts are executable
chmod +x mobius-verify.sh scripts/*.sh

# Run verification
npm run mobius:verify:unix
# or directly
bash ./mobius-verify.sh
```

### Windows
```cmd
# Run verification
npm run mobius:verify
# or directly double-click mobius-verify.cmd in Explorer
# or run from cmd.exe
mobius-verify.cmd
```

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
# Run PS versions directly with bypass
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\kill-ports.ps1 -Ports 5001,3000
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\mobius-verify.cmd
```

## Log Locations

### Unix
- Backend log: `/tmp/mobius-backend.log`
- Frontend log: `/tmp/mobius-frontend.log`

### Windows
- Backend log: `%TEMP%\mobius-backend.log`
- Frontend log: `%TEMP%\mobius-frontend.log`

## Minimal Smoke-Check Commands

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/healthz
```

### Frontend Basic Check
```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:3000 | head -n 5
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
All critical scripts provided in both bash (.sh) and PowerShell (.ps1) versions for maximum compatibility.

### Robust Process Management
Scripts properly handle process cleanup and port conflicts, ensuring reliable verification runs.

### Health Checks
Scripts wait for services to be ready by checking actual health endpoints rather than using fixed timeouts.

### Standardized Logging
Consistent logging format with clear status indicators for easy debugging.

### CI Integration
GitHub Actions workflow enables automated verification in CI environments.

## Testing Completed
The verification scripts have been tested and confirmed to:
1. Start both backend and frontend services correctly
2. Wait for services to be ready by checking health endpoints
3. Run smoke tests successfully
4. Clean up processes properly
5. Handle port conflicts gracefully

## Ready for Next Steps

The verification system is now complete and ready for use. The recommended next steps are:

1. **Add UI smoke tests with Playwright** - For enhanced UI stability in CI
2. **Harden health endpoints** - Improve reliability of verification with more detailed status endpoints
3. **Create a Node-based orchestrator** - For even cleaner cross-platform process management
4. **Open a PR with all changes** - Formalize the work and make it available to the team

All scripts follow the project's cross-platform requirements and are ready for immediate use in both development and CI environments.
