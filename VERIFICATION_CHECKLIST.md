## Success Criteria

All checklist items above should be marked as complete before considering the implementation finished.

## Known Issues

### Jest/ESM Compatibility
- Some unit tests may fail due to ESM module compatibility issues
- Workaround: Use smoke tests for integration verification
- Long-term fix: Update Jest configuration for ESM support

### Browser Compatibility
- Some CSS features may not work in older browsers
- Solution: Add appropriate polyfills or fallbacks
- Verification: Test in target browser versions

## Verification Commands

```bash
