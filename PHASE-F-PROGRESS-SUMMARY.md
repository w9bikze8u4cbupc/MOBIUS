## Key Features Implemented

### Script Editing
- Add/rename chapters
- Add/reorder/delete steps
- Edit step text content
- Chapter and step selection
- Preview individual chapters

### Data Management
- Undo/redo functionality
- Autosave to localStorage
- Export to JSON bundle (chapters + SRT)
- Data persistence across sessions

### Image Management
- Drag-and-drop image placement
- Image library with sample assets
- Per-step image associations
- Image removal functionality

### Backend Integration
- Preview generation endpoint
- Export packaging endpoint
- Static file serving for assets
- Metrics collection for monitoring

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
- Component-based React implementation
- Custom hooks for state management
- Utility functions for data handling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for development and build tooling

### Backend Architecture
- Express.js REST API endpoints
- Multer for file handling
- JSON data persistence
- Metrics collection with prom-client
- Queue management for resource control

### Data Flow
1. User edits script in browser
2. Changes are autosaved to localStorage
3. Undo/redo snapshots are maintained
4. Export generates chapters.json and SRT files
5. Images can be associated with steps
6. Preview requests are processed by backend
7. All operations are tracked with metrics

## Next Steps

### 1. Preview Renderer Integration
- Connect frontend preview button to backend endpoint
- Implement actual video generation pipeline
- Add progress indicators for preview generation
- Create preview player UI

### 2. Packaging System
- Implement ZIP packaging of all tutorial assets
- Add asset validation before packaging
- Create download functionality for packaged tutorials
- Implement versioning for exported packages

### 3. Enhanced Image Matching
- Add support for actual image uploads
- Implement image positioning and sizing controls
- Add support for multiple image placements per step
- Create image library management

### 4. Additional Script Features
- Add timing controls per step
- Implement voiceover hints
- Add tagging system for steps
- Create template system for common step types

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Implement search functionality
- Create tutorial onboarding
- Add dark mode support

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/preview` - Generate chapter preview
- `POST /api/export` - Package tutorial data
- `GET /api/preview/:previewId` - Get preview status

### Existing Endpoints Enhanced
- `/api/ingest` - Added queue management and rate limiting
- `/health` - Added version header
- `/metrics` - Added new counters for preview/export

## Configuration Options

### Frontend
- Autosave interval (default: 1200ms)
- Tab navigation between editor and image matcher
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

### Backend
- `API_VERSION` - API version header
- `INGEST_MAX_CONCURRENCY` - Maximum concurrent ingestion tasks
- `INGEST_QUEUE_MAX` - Maximum queue size for ingestion
- `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` - Maximum upload file size
- `BGG_CACHE_TTL_MS` - BGG cache time-to-live
- `BGG_RATE_LIMIT_QPS` - BGG API rate limit
- `KEEP_UPLOADS_DAYS` - Upload retention period
- `KEEP_OUTPUT_DAYS` - Output retention period

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Queue management tests
- Cache service tests
- Janitor job tests
- Script utility function tests

### Integration Points
- API endpoint testing
- File upload validation
- Preview generation verification
- Export packaging validation

## Deployment

### Development
- `npm run server` - Start backend API
- `npm run ui` - Start frontend development server

### Production
- Build frontend with `vite build`
- Deploy backend with process manager
- Configure reverse proxy for API/frontend
- Set up data directory with proper permissions

## Security Considerations

- File type validation for uploads
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Size limits for uploaded files
- Encrypted PDF rejection
- Suspicious content scanning

## Performance Optimizations

- Concurrent ingestion processing
- Queue-based back-pressure management
- BGG metadata caching
- BGG API rate limiting
- Automated file retention
