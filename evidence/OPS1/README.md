- Update `notarization_transcript.md` with the notarization call notes immediately after receipt.
- If additional OPS1 runbooks or checklists arrive, add them alongside this transcript with concise filenames.
- Keep timestamps in Pacific Time and include the operator who captured the evidence at the top of each file.
