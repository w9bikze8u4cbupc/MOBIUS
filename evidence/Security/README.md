# Security Evidence Staging

- Fill in `security_signoff.md` with the formal attestation once Security ships the notarized clearance.
- Attach vulnerability scan IDs, ticket numbers, or CVE references inline so validation can happen without cross-searching.
- Include reviewer initials and verification timestamp at the top of each document.
