# Security Evidence Staging

**Purpose:** Capture final security approvals, including threat model sign-off and any conditional exceptions.

## Required artifact
- `security_signoff.md`: Signed statement from the security duty officer with references to risk assessments and mitigation owners.

## Submission checklist
- [ ] Provide explicit go/no-go decision with timestamp.
- [ ] Enumerate any temporary exceptions with expiry dates.
- [ ] Link to vulnerability scan outputs or attach summaries.

Notify the security liaison and readiness coordinator once the sign-off is uploaded so the Delta Register can be updated immediately.
