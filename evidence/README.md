# Evidence Intake Overview

The `evidence/` directory provides a centralized staging area for the operational artifacts required to close remaining readiness gaps. Each subdirectory contains role-specific instructions and drop zones for time-sensitive documentation.

- `OPS1/` — notarization and release authorization checkpoints
- `OPS2/` — deployment window coordination and rollback validation
- `Security/` — security posture confirmations and exception handling

Follow the guidance in each folder before adding or updating evidence. Once artifacts are captured, notify the readiness coordinator so they can be ingested into the Readiness Delta Register.
