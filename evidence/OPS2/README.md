# OPS2 Evidence Staging

**Purpose:** Document the authorized rollback window and any operational guardrails required during the deployment.

## Required artifact
- `rollback_window_confirmation.md`: Confirmation from the change management bridge including start/end times, command center contacts, and pager rotations.

## Submission checklist
- [ ] Capture the latest approved window (date + UTC time range).
- [ ] Note any conflicting maintenance events or freezes.
- [ ] Attach confirmation that rollback automation was smoke-tested within the last 24 hours.

Once confirmed, notify OPS leadership and the readiness coordinator so the Delta Register reflects the updated rollback posture.
