# OPS2 Evidence Staging

- Populate `rollback_window_confirmation.md` with the approved deployment window once OPS2 signs off.
- Include any incident bridge links or ticket references directly in the file body to keep context colocated.
- Note the source email or chat thread for traceability at the bottom of each artifact.
